            "review": "Some diehard **Star Trek** fans may not necessarily feel that the Justin Lin-directed third installment of this science fiction/space saga film franchise \u201cboldly goes where no man has gone before\u201d creatively. Surprisingly, Lin (director of two \u201cFast & Furious\u201d flicks) shows some engaging and intriguing heft in **Star Trek Beyond** as the adventurous exploits of the USS Enterprise crew are likely to stir the collective pot where the nostalgic sentiments of the Star Trek brand from yesteryear bridges the gap to the current cinematic explosiveness of modern-day Captain Kirk and company. Although it is extremely difficult to immediately dismiss filmmaker J.J. Abrams\u2019s resourceful fingerprints concerning the imaginative **Star Trek** (2009) and the thoroughly enjoyable **Star Trek Into Darkness** (2013) he graciously steps aside to allow Lin\u2019s energizing directorial vision to further explore Trek mythology on the big screen.\r\n\r\nEssentially, **Star Trek Beyond** is a vibrant cosmic canvas that is expansive in its boundaries of exploration. Visually arresting, well-paced and armed with compelling story-telling and a healthy dosage of curiosity and mystery, Lin manages to stay true to the traditional Trek-oriented universe by incorporating rousing special effects and offering a galactic grandeur of planetary peculiarities and exotic alien races to stimulate the exquisite narrative. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (Star Trek\u2019s on-screen character Montgomery \u201cScotty\u201d Scott) incorporate an eye-opening mixture of dramatic edginess, off-the-cuff humor and the cohesive rapport among the cast-mates that have inherited the iconic Star Trek personalities and made these familiar faces from the classic 60\u2019s TV show and previous non-reboot films a revelation in the millennium age of blockbuster sci-fi action adventure.\r\n\r\nThe plot channels in a sense of challenging malaise for the USS Enterprise\u2019s top officers in Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). What seemingly spices things up regarding the deja vu space journeys aboard the spacecraft is the questionable and powerful device that Kirk and his crew are babysitting. This powerful tool of destruction is capable of destroying humanity as we know it. In particular, the opportunistic Krall (Idris Elba) is the lizard-looking culprit determined to get his diabolical hands on the corrosive contraption. Naturally, Krall and his menacing minions must subdue Kirk and his crew to achieve success in having this ominous object in his deadly grasp. Krall\u2019s willingness to cripple the USS Enterprise proved to be an ambitious mission fully accomplished. For Kirk and his group the results were disheartening as Krall\u2019s forceful attacks rendered the ship disabled as it crashed on the desolate planet of Altamid. Thus, Kirk and his charges are stranded on his rocky haven with no hope in sight. The harsh reality for the vulnerable USS Enterprise visitors, besides being divided and scattered in all directions on this problematic planet, involved getting into survival mode as the hostile reptilian creatures surrounded them at will.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned split of Kirk and his exposed cohorts called for a series of various crisis carried on at different, chaotic spots. Kirk and Russian crew member Pavel Chekov (played by the late Anton Yelchin) were primarily tasked with trying to rescue their colleagues from the claws of Krall and his cronies. Elsewhere, Dr. Bones (Keith Urban) tries to patch up the injured Spock following the aftermath of the ship\u2019s wrecking. Pegg\u2019s Scotty and womanly warrior in alien Jayla (Sofia Boutella) make the valiant effort in trying to reach Kirk in the middle of total ribaldry.\r\n\r\n**Star Trek Beyond** has stylized flash and Lin ensures that his pulsating production stays faithful to the Trek legacy. Sure, **Beyond** is not anything innovative or wildly distinctive in comparison to the other earlier entries but it still thrives where it counts in the spectacle of space-aged escapism. The cast is solid as the players\u2013Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin as well as Zoe Saldana\u2019s Uhura and John Cho\u2019s Sulu\u2013all demonstrate a suspenseful unity on screen and give the audience an indescribable excitement in this latest chapter that far from disappoints. Elba\u2019s Krall is robustly villainous in physicality and attitude and the alien race featured are interestingly hypnotic in creepiness. Lin, in the same vein as Abrams, is not shy about gift-wrapping his **Star Trek** edition in boisterous, sweeping helpings of scope and whimsy.\r\n\r\nOverall, this kinetic outing of **Beyond** practically guarantees that the rebooted **Star Trek** phenomenon will not be experiencing its final frontier any time soon.\r\n\r\n**Star Trek Beyond** (2016)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Idris Elba, Sofia Boutella\r\n\r\nDirected by: Justin Lin\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Space and Fantasy Saga/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016)"

Yeah, it was Viola Davis, who snatched the most prestigious award for her supporting actress role. Originally the film based on the stage play of the same name. It is a drama takes place in the 50s about a hard working family man, Troy. His past was not very good, which makes him a little arrogant when it comes to raining his boy. Marrying Rose was the best ever thing happened in his life. Though it was not a perfect family. The differences between them is what later bring twist and turns in the tale before heading for the final of the final act.\r\n\r\nA very simple drama on the fine topic. Most of the film was just a conversation or arguments. And most of the film was little slow moving with the very long overall runtime. If you can manage that, you can enjoy it. If you are a drama genre fan, then you will be more than happy for giving it a try. One of the best drama films of the year, yet not the greatest. It's all finger points at the performances. Those magnificent actors displayed magnificent show. Nearly 35 years old screenplay and 70 years old timeline, still looked the same and powerful. Despite the film's success and poured praises, I don't think it is for everyone. Definitely young generations won't enjoy it. It is mainly for families.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film avoids the usual clich\u00e9. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

He did this earlier with films like Ghilli, Pokkiri and Thuppakki, and does it now with Jilla. This time, he shares the glory with Mohanlal, who plays his godfather in the film. The plot revolves around Sivan (Mohanlal), a don in Madurai, who brings up Sakthi (Vijay), whose father died for him, as his own son. The two are a formidable force in the city but circumstances force Sivan to ask Sakthi to become a cop. But when an accident results in the death of several innocents, Sakthi wants his father to turn over a new leaf. But the older man is not in the mood to heed his advice, and soon, the two are on opposing sides. \r\n\r\nAs far as commercial films are concerned, Jilla is definitely assured filmmaking. Neason understands that the conflict between Sivan and Sakthi is what powers his film and sets up the initial clash between these two characters very well. Sakthi's realizes the error of his ways after a horrible blast, which happens because of Sivan's decision. The scenes following this blast are quite horrific for this kind of film but they are so effective in making us understand why someone as loyal as Sakthi will shift sides and decides to take on the person who is his father figure. The confrontation scene is very well shot and the dialogues too are punchy in this scene. Vijay and Mohanlal are very good here. Vijay utters Sakthi's lines in a nonchalant way (Unakkaga enaku pidikadha khakhi potu police aanen illa, enakkaga nee ippo nallavana maaru) while Mohanlal treats Sivan's lines with seriousness, and so we get to see where each character stands \u2014 the son only wants his father to change but the latter will not give an inch from his position and is even ready to banish him from the house. When the intermission point arrives, we eagerly anticipate what might come next. \r\n\r\nNeason also keeps Sivan's character in the grey area \u2014 he never has any remorse for the blast, he even brokers for a pharma company which is banned everywhere in the world; he is so egoistic that he wants to put Sakthi in place at any cost. Which is why, we feel cheated when the director decides to bring in another antagonist who wants to bring down the father-son duo. Thankfully, our disappointment doesn't last long as this character poses a formidable challenge to Sakthi and that keeps this segment engaging. He even has a minor victory when he manages to kill a character close to Sakthi and Sivan. \r\n\r\nThe lighter portions too are done with confidence. Neason understands the irony of a guy who hates the khakhi falling in love with a woman who is a cop, and treats the romance in a playful manner. He even approaches the scene in which Sivan urges Sakthi to become a cop in a similar vein. A godfather asking his son to do something he hates is heavy duty drama material but the director sidesteps this by going for a good-humoured tone, and just to not make it appear too frivolous, makes Sakthi tell his mom that he will do anything to not see his dad tearing up again. He also manages to get away with the implausible scenario of a don's hireling becoming a cop. \r\n\r\nThe main issue with Jilla is that it is overlong. Neason, probably in an effort to make it a wholesome entertainer, keeps packing in scenes oblivious to the running time. So, we have an unwarranted sub-plot involving Sakthi's sister and forcefully fitted songs which only make the film lengthy. Also, his tendency to cut to a childhood moment every time he wants to make an emotional statement becomes gratuitous after a point \u2014 the film itself begins with Sakthi as a boy; when Sakthi is injured, he recalls a moment when Sivan rushed to him when he injured himself as a boy; when his brother talks about growing up holding Sakthi's hands, he cuts to a montage of two boys holding hands."

            "review": "> A complete action pack, with not so popular actors.\r\n\r\nThis is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.\r\n\r\nThe money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.\r\n\r\nThe other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Because when the first movie came I thought it was a nice idea and then its sequel was so bad without any further innovative ideas to add up. I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.\r\n\r\nBen Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason. Don't expect high, because it won't serve you.\r\n\r\n5/10"

            "review": "Locke precariously drives down the road of crushing solitude. Concrete. A highly versatile construction material that harnesses strength and durability as aspects of its properties. Impact and fire resistant. A common element for brutalist architecture. And just like the eponymous construction foreman, all it takes is for one mistake. The most minuscule of errors, before an erected building collapses. Unable to withstand the misjudgement of its foundations. Locke, as he drives his tissue-littered BMW X5 from Birmingham to London, must confront unintentional accidents that have caused his mentality to inadvertently spiral out of control.\r\n\r\nA one night stand with Colman as she gives birth to a miscalculated oversight. Consequently causing Locke to abruptly depart for the hospital, resulting in his job dismissal and a construction company spending millions more on a building that has yet to come to fruition. Confronting his own family, showcasing honesty in the most desperate of situations. An hour and a half drive (\u201cas fast as the traffic will allow\u201d). Thirty six phone calls. A life dissolving in the confinement\u2019s of one location. He had everything. Security. Family. Shelter. Only for them to be removed by signalled communications in the luxury of his BMW.\r\n\r\nKnight illustrates the power of simplicity. No flashy visualised distractions. No abrupt editing mechanics. No action. The thrills, tension and drama stem from a screenplay that has its extremities tested by consistently filming in real-time. Allowing the dialogue to be the only aspect at the forefront. We witness an individual deal with the stresses of life. Both professional and personal. Examining the moralities of a man who strives to differ from his irresponsible father. But his wife\u2019s rebuttal is an opaque sentiment that challenges forgiveness. \u201cThe difference between never and once is the difference between good and bad\u201d. An eternally resonant message that self-drives this car journey into the realms of virtuosity.\r\n\r\nKnight\u2019s purposeful choice of enhancing the claustrophobic environment complements the depiction of Locke\u2019s world, as he knows it, swirling in on him. Reducing the boundaries of his breathing space. His stress and anxiety heightening with each phone call he receives. However, none of the above would\u2019ve been as effective if it wasn\u2019t for Hardy\u2019s exceptionally tantalising performance. Far from a car crash, he manages to centralise the focus on him with the camera rarely moving away from his bloodshot eyes or fatigued face. His desperation and intrusive responses illustrates loneliness on a more empathetic wavelength.\r\n\r\nDespite the act of adultery, you never view Locke as an antagonistic entity. He does his best to find \u201cthe next practical step\u201d whilst retaining the thoughts of the recipients in his own head. It\u2019s relatable, personally, on a level that cancels out the background noise. And that, is a powerful dramatic endeavour.\r\n\r\nThere are a few bumps on the motorway though. The various scenes where Locke talks to himself, as if he\u2019s talking to his father, were somewhat cumbersome techniques in order to convey his opposing stance to his father that still haunts him. It\u2019s not particularly subtle, and contrasts heavily with the dramatic phone calls. A desperate attempt to convey abandonment, which would\u2019ve been alleviated by a simple phone chat instead. It\u2019s not shot in one take, and so editor Wright embeds scenes of traffic and the bright luminescence of roads to segregate the narrative flow. These occur too frequently and conceives an occasional irregular pace. And the maternity nurse wasn\u2019t particularly helpful by constantly spluttering \u201cshe\u2019s afraid\u201d whilst Locke clearly stated he was on his way. Give the man a break!\r\n\r\nDespite these bumps, Locke is a smooth drive with dramatic heft and cinematic experimentalism. An irony of a construction worker having his life demolished in minutes. Testing an individual\u2019s moralities through a variety of stress-inducing situations, culminating into an illustration on solidarity. Hardy confidently drives the plot to its desired destination, \u201cspeed limits\u201d included."

            "review": "No doubt that actress Melissa McCarthy has become a pop cultural phenomenon within the last few years. She has hit the jackpot in a career gone on a whirlwind upswing. McCarthy has just ended a six-year run from her Emmy-winning turn on the popular CBS sitcom **Mike and Molly**. She was Oscar-nominated for her performance in **Bridesmaids**. She has made a slew of hit-and-miss comedies. Her hosting stints on the legendary **Saturday Night Live** are riotous. McCarthy is part of the much-talked about upcoming female version of the wildly treasured 80's cult classic comedy **Ghostbusters**. Additionally, ardent fanatics of the 2000-2007 WB network TV series **Gilmore Girls** recently rejoiced when McCarthy agreed to join the Netflix revival show that previously endeared her to television audience years before. So yes...to say that Melissa McCarthy is on a continued roll with her ubiquitous presence in TV and movies is an understatement.\r\n\r\nIn McCarthy's latest broad comedy **The Boss** she and her husband Ben Falcone (\"Bridesmaids\") collaborate as they--along with Steve Mallory--co-wrote the script with Falcone taking over the directorial duties. In fact, both McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the 2014 vehicle **Tammy** starring McCarthy with Falcone in the director's chair as well. So it is a relief to see how this Hollywood couple bond creatively over their film projects. However, it is not all that encouraging that the Falcones have subsided over generic laughfests. \r\n\r\nOn the surface **The Boss** could be perceived as a wacky female empowerment romp but dig deeper and this lackluster comedy has all the one-note comical deepness of a frizzled Phyllis Diller wig. McCarthy plays the brash and blistery Michelle Darnell, a Martha Stewart-esque CEO financial wizard with a convincing pretty penny that makes up her unbelievable fortune. In fact, Michelle happens to be the 47th wealthiest woman in America. Unfortunately, the law caught up with Michelle so now she is behind bars for inside trading.\r\n\r\nAfter months of doing \"hard time\" (in reality \"soft time\" for the jailed demanding diva), Michelle is released where she learns of her frozen assets and diminutive ex-lover and rival entrepreneur Renault (Peter Dinklage) who has taken over her multi-million dollar companies. With nowhere to turn for support Michelle decides to intrude on her long-suffering former personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). The tolerant Claire is a single mother to 10-year old Rachel (Ella Anderson). As one can imagine the insufferable Michelle is a terror in poor Claire's household with her bossy demeanor. Apparently Claire's nastiness is just not reserved for Claire as she has plenty of scorn to go around for the ones who dare to step in her way.\r\n\r\nSoon, Michelle discovers a way to get back into the capitalism game and recapture her status as a wealth-driven Wonder Woman. The agenda involves Rachel's Dandelion troop as inspiration for Michelle scheming to recruit the outcast girls from the Dandelions (dubbed \"Darnell's Darlings) to sell the exceptional brownies based upon Claire's crafty recipe. Naturally, Michelle is hard on the little gals to push her need for reaching success but in her own caring way she wants to educate the Darlings to become strong, independent future businesswomen armed with potential power and poise. With Michelle's sad-sack backstory as a rejected little girl raised in a Catholic orphanage where many foster homes denied her existence it is clear that the seemingly cold and calculating Michelle does not want her hardship to be repeated in the group of girls she is grooming for the kill of conquering the business world.   \r\n\r\n**The Boss** has some slapstick moments that are passable and the always game McCarthy is willing to do what it takes to sell the zany goods to ensure the hefty chuckles. Playing hard-nose harlots such as the coarse Michelle Darnell is McCarthy's specialty and she is effective when the material supports her tyrannical pushiness. However, **The Boss** feels lackluster because McCarthy's sketchy bits are slight and the movie's basic follow-the-dots lunacy is never on par with McCarthy's bombastic business-minded bulldog. The movie feels cheaply lifted from the hybrid boundaries of 1989's **Troop Beverly Hills** paired with 1988's **Big Business.**\r\n\r\nThankfully, **The Boss** is not as tepid or forgettable as McCarthy's other outings such as the aforementioned **Tammy** or **Identity Theft**. On the flip side, this toothless romp will never rub shoulders with the more acceptable McCarthy staples in **Bridesmaids**, **The Heat** or **Spy** either. In short, this particular **Boss** ought to be demoted to the unemployment line.\r\n\r\n**The Boss** (2016)\r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n99 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage, Ella Anderson, Kathy Bates, Tyler Labine\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ben Falcone\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng"

            "review": "A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nAnyone who is fortunate enough to share their life with a companion animal will undoubtedly get a kick out of the latest Illumination animated effort, \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets.\u201d The film soars when it focuses on animals interacting with their human guardians, with the canine and feline characters acting like real pets do (if my cats could talk, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d converse in  similar dialogue as portrayed onscreen). The first part of the movie is incredibly perceptive and clever, as is the last 10 minutes because it zeroes in on these very relationships (the opening and closing scenes of the movie are touching and have lots of heart). The problem comes in the middle when the story stops being about \u2018pets being pets.\u2019 Sadly, the majority of the film lags when it ventures into the dreaded animated movie territory of sheer stupidity.\r\n\r\nLoveable human Katie (Ellie Kemper) and her pup Max (Louis C.K.) are the best of friends. Max has several animal buddies that live in the same New York City high rise, including dogs, cats, birds and guinea pigs that stop by for daily visits. When Katie brings home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) from the animal shelter, Max devises a plan to get rid of him. Problem is, the two dogs find themselves lost in the big city and Max\u2019s would-be girlfriend Gidget (Jenny Slate) takes it upon herself to recruit other pets \u2014 including the elderly paralyzed basset hound Pops (Dana Carvey) and lonely falcon Tiberius (Albert Brooks) \u2014 to bring Max home. Along the way they find themselves at odds with the anarchist gang of \u201cflushed pets,\u201d a group of outspoken, anti-human animals led by former magician\u2019s bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart).\r\n\r\nThe voice acting runs the gamut from phenomenally good (Slate) to wince inducing (Hart). Slate is perfectly cast as Gidget, a poufy white spoiled little dog who eventually saves the day. She proves herself tenfold as a legitimate voiceover actor, and I hope to see her get more work in animation in the future. There\u2019s no denying that Hart is a super likeable actor, but his portrayal of Snowball the bunny is nothing more than repeated, strained yelling. His overall performance felt so labored and unnatural that listening to him onscreen actually made me uncomfortable. I will not hesitate to nominate Hart for a Razzie award for worst actor of the year because his voice work is that bad.\r\n\r\nIn the \u2018oh no, not again\u2019 category, there\u2019s plenty of dopey, brainless scenarios crammed in with a feeling that their sole existence is to appease young kids. We get yet another ridiculous animal driving a car stunt that we had to endure in this summer\u2019s nearly insufferable \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d In fact, in \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d we get not only a rabbit driving a van but also a lizard driving a bus and a pig driving a taxi.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity isn\u2019t the only problem: it\u2019s the repetition. The filmmakers must\u2019ve run out of good ideas and instead of moving the story forward, the audience gets the same monotony over and over and over again. I don\u2019t require my animated films to be completely based in reality (there\u2019s a particularly amusing Busby Berkeley inspired musical sequence in a sausage factory), but I do expect more originality than is delivered in this movie. The story at times takes a cynical approach in several places and some of the themes may be too much for sensitive kids (but the film provides a great starting point for a learning opportunity about pets and how animals shouldn\u2019t be viewed as disposable).\r\n\r\nAt least the animation is commendable, nice and colorful with lively, fully realized backgrounds. It\u2019s visually interesting enough for adults and fans of the genre but it\u2019s also vibrant and bustling enough to keep the kids interested. There\u2019s a lovely original score with a lighthearted, almost vintage sound. For me, the original music in this film is one of the standout elements.\r\n\r\nOverall I feel like this film takes a great idea and almost completely wastes the opportunity. This dull, unremarkable action caper is mostly moronic, but the imaginative peek behind the door at an animal\u2019s life when the humans are away is what\u2019s pure gold. I really wish the film had focused on that component. \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d is fine, but isn\u2019t destined for greatness.  \r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**"

So this tale is about an explosion at a Chinese nuclear plant and followed by the investigation conducted by the US and Chinese collaboration, the cops hire a convicted hacker to fast up the process and to nab the culprit who was behind the power plant disaster. These people begin their hunting by tracking the clues to the different locations and where they finally land and how it all come end told in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nI felt it was a too much realistic presentation. Like a documentary film quality, but full suspense filled story that stretched to over two hours. So sometimes it was very boring, because slowing down in any big development. At a time, some of the important scenes accomplished so fast like most of the action sequences. It mainly revolved around hacking plot, but was not that intelligent, so can be understood by everyone.\r\n\r\nInitially I disliked those circuit board graphics, which I thought was a good detail, but too much for a film like this and it never looked so convincing. The film was average, but I anticipated lot better than that. I liked the actors though. Whether it was Chris Hemsworth or the Chinese counterparts, all were decent according to what the tale required. The film is not for everybody, particularly if you don't like slow narration, you should not consider it to watch. But the film is not bad for once viewing.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

            "review": "Sometimes you gotta sacrifice a single sheep to save the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Salvation is directed by Kristian Levring and Levring co-writes the screenplay with Anders Thomas Jensen. It stars Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Cantona, Mikael Persbrandt, Jonathan Pryce and Douglas Henshall. Music is by Kasper Winding and cinematography by Jens Schlosser.\r\n\r\n1871 and ex-patriot Danish soldier Jon Jensen (Mikkelsen) is, after 7 years of foundation building, welcoming his wife and son to a new life in America. But after they all board a stagecoach bound for their homestead, events will see that journey not be completed. And thus begins a tale of retribution and redemption. \r\n\r\nThere are few smiles in The Salvation, in fact viewers will need to grab onto the sparse offerings of such very early in the piece. For it's a film of blood, brooding and misery, of intensity and a paucity of the good side of human nature. Levring has managed to successfully blend the traditions of the American Western with the feel of the Euro Spaghetti Oaters. There is so much for Western fans to enjoy here. It's a classic revenger pumped by a good versus bad heart, yet as pared down and as simple as the story may at first seem, there's interesting asides of worth. \r\n\r\nThe issue of Euro immigrants trying to make it in the Wild West is noteworthy, while there's a delicious juxtaposition between two soldiers from different continents, and different wars. Jensen fought the Germans in Europe, while his nemesis, Henry Delarue (Morgan), has been through the Indian wars. A most interesting comparison, one where the characterisations are vividly opposed to each other. Add in a good old town in the grip of a tyrant theme, and a bit of carnal desires upon thine brother's spouse, and it's a spicy hot pot.\r\n\r\nFilmed at dusty South African locations, there's a scenic beauty surrounding the harsh story. Westerns don't have to be filmed in America to look authentic, and this is a case in point. The town of Black Creek has been called fake looking in some quarters, not so. This is a new up-coming town, it's meant to be wooden and sparse. Hell! The saloon is also the local store, the mayor is also the undertaker, this is a basic Wild West town without frills and fancy.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the costuming is splendid, especially Morgan who is nicely dapper in black hat and crimson mack, and there's a whole host of face fuzz on show, which is needed to keep up the whole mud and blood, hard West factor. Levring has an eye for a nice shot, such as a full moon bearing witness, even a traditional slow-mo piece. All that said, irks do exist, Green's character is sketchily drawn, but she's playing a heaving bosom mute (her tongue was cut out by the pesky Indians), so scope for development is admittedly limited. While Winding's score is a bit too modern sounding for the key shoot-out sequences.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's great to see the Western is still thriving in this day and age of CGI and blockbuster pandering. From the shattering and moody first quarter to the bloody and excellently staged finale, The Salvation keeps the Western genre well and truly alive. 9/10"

Perhaps I was noticing it more due to viewing with subtitles, but there's a lot of moments where we see Sandra (Cotillard) retrace the same steps with each individual - it gets repetitive.\r\n\r\nCotillard, though, is top notch. She brings so much emotion and realness with her, nailing every single scene to deserve notable props. Away from the Parisian, there aren't any others to note; they are all fine but I would've loved a more meaty cast.\r\n\r\nI'd be rating it a level lower if it wasn't for the lead, who is easily the best thing to come out of <em>'Two Days, One Night'</em>."

            "review": "In filmmaker Scott Derrickson\u2019s original \u2018Sinister\u2019, this writer\u2019s critical impressions toward the sub-par psychological yarn was rather blunt if not consistent with the steady diet of formulaic fightfests. The following passage pretty much sums up the cinematic sentiments from the movie\u2019s critique:\r\n\r\n'At best Sinister is a lukewarm twitchy tale that routinely teases the audience with the obligatory guessing game of whether or not the conjured up evil-minded spookiness is imagined\u2026cheapened scare tactics, an ambiguous monstrous myth, transparent characterizations and a mixed bag of a supernatural storyline barely put any Sinister thoughts in our heads worth contemplating.\u2018\r\n\r\nWell, say what you will about the first \u2018Sinister\u2019 outing but it at least had some slight star power in lead Ethan Hawke whose presence was one of the minor pluses in Derrickson\u2019s shoddy shocker. In director Ciaran Foy\u2019s (\u2018The Citadel\u2019) tingling yet generic \u2018Sinister II\u2019, we hardly experience the essence of top-notch horror-induced hedonism. Feverishly flat, the creepily clich\u00e9d \u2018Sinister II\u2019 continues the tedious tradition of assembling sure-fire goose bump moments yet never really fortifying these mentioned moments with any heft of genuine suspense or titillating intelligence. At best, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 skillfully demonstrates its somber shell but horror movies in general, at least ones that strive for sophistication and coherence, should not continuously hide behind the sketchy synthetics of macabre mediocrity.\r\n\r\n'Sinister II\u2019 dutifully shares its symbolic connection with its predecessor. For starters, \u2018Sinister\u2019 alum James Ransone (the deputy from the first film) returns to the perverse playground while being blessed with a lead role in this frightful follow-up. After his dubious dealings with the Oswalt family in the first film\u2019 where he was part of the police force\u2019 the former law enforcer now works as a private investigator in his continued quest to combat that pesky spirit known as the demon Baghuul. Ransone\u2019s ex-deputy is consumed with the shocking murders that took place previously, so it is his mission to eradicate the further Baghuul-instigated mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe newest family involved in the menacing mix consists of an Indiana farmhouse containing a mother named Courtney Collins (Shannyn Sossamon) and her two young sons (real-life brothers Dartanain Sloan and Robert Sloan). Unfortunately, Courtney is battling back and forth with her insufferable and indignant husband (Lea Coco) as her poor boys are caught up in the heated drama. The last thing that Courtney needs is a domestic distraction in the farmhouse that incorporates the spookiness of the Baghuul\u2019s mischievousness. Thus, the hapless deputy-turned-PI must do what it takes to prevent the Baghuul from corrupting the psyches of this vulnerable family unit.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s screenplay, written by Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, plays up to its predictable strengths as the audience is already steeped in the \u2018Sinister\u2019 mindset. Unfortunately, the element of mystery and intrigue is already compromised because \u2018Sinister II\u2019 does not really leave much second guessing for its titillating tension since it already displayed the same kind of copycat gloom-and-doom blueprint as evidenced in the first installment. In echoing the familiar patterns of eerie scare tactics, this sequel merely mirrors the shady shenanigans found in the first showing that was not that innovative the original time around. Sure, the unsettling imagery does have some warranted punch that leaves somewhat of a horrific impact. The grainy and gruesome home film angle showing a family\u2019s hanging is undoubtedly quite affecting but the shock factor is brief and oddly forgettable. One is left wondering if there are enough tingly tricks up Foy\u2019s desperate sleeve to arm \u2018Sinister II\u2019 with more than just drab shadows and twitchy innuendo.\r\n\r\nIndeed, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 is atmospheric and bleak and does a sure fire job of creating a dank and disturbing universe where the percolating peril steadily brims. However, that is the problem with \u2018Sinister II\u2019 as it settles for the surface-base hedonistic haunting without committing to anything morbidly motivating sans the convoluted creepy conventions. Ransone\u2019s bid to expose the imposing beast Baghuul while protecting the fragile welfare of the vulnerable Collins is genuinely a number-by-number plotline that feels stillborn. Even the dastardly Baghuul is stripped of anything particularly mysterious or diabolical for the audience to get on board and become mortified. Resembling a late gray-bluish sandpaper-faced rocker in The Doors\u2019 frontman Jim Morrison with long stringy hair and mod attire, the Baghuul does nothing to really stimulate the gory imagination of \u2018Sinister\u2019s movie-making mythology\r\n\r\nLittle beauty and the rock n' roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER. \r\nLittle beauty and the rock n\u2019 roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER.\r\nIn the long run, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 sings a spooky song in many ways but arms its tepid tune with the continued cheap thrills and false jump edits that are so annoyingly common in contemporary creepfests. \u2018Sinister\u2019s crime is not so much the calculating presence of a haunt hipster looking to stunt the growth of bewildered housing inhabitants as it is following the pedestrian path of boofests with banal bangs of exhilaration.\r\n\r\nSinister II (2015)\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr  30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Dartanain Sloan, Robert Sloan and Lea Coco\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ciaran Foy\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Psychological Thriller/Supernatural & Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * * stars (out of 4 stars)"

But someone clarified that it was not made outside the novel to make money. It's indeed adapted from the sequel book of the original film's source. Though coming out 20 years later was the disadvantage. Except some praises it had received, particularly by its hardcore fans, it was average at the box office and I thought same as well.\r\n\r\nI did not like the story. It was just a random drag, not knowing what direction to head. That's until the third act, and once all the three main characters come together, so it gets interesting with something. Like surviving from from a revenge threat. It was the actors who saved the film. Otherwise, it is not even an average as I consider now. I don't think retaining the title was a good idea, but I think it was just for its fans. Or else, a new title name would have done a decent justice to what it had narrated.\r\n\r\nAs I know, this is the director's first ever sequel and he's not getting better since his Oscar win, a decade ago. Especially the last two flicks, despite based on the very good subjects. Definitely no to the T3. Instead, I want another Oscar nod film from him. This would have been ever worse if somebody else would have made it. Yet, a watchable film, only if you had liked the first. So just think about it before going for it after seeing only positive words from a few people.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"
