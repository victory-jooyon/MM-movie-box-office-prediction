But the pacing of the story was slow that I was close to snoozing off. I felt like there were some scenes in the movie that should've been cut off."

So he wages a one man war against pretty much everyone involved. \r\n\r\nHoo-Hah! The big hitting critics hated it, with comments ranging from it being sub-normal, preposterous, ugly and morally corrupt, to it being a comic book film of moral hectoring! Naturally, as the critics were at pains to point out that it would, it made a pot load at the box office and is generally well liked by a good portion of the action/revenge/thriller loving populace.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s always a big grey area with revenge/vigilante movies that really brings out the debate crowd, but what rarely gets said is that through the actions of these cinematic waste layers is the chance for many, many, folk to live vicariously. Yes! 99% of the common man and woman do indeed sit back and trust our respective legal systems to do what\u2019s right and just, but oh how we feel that given similar circumstances we would want to vent spleen with furious anger.\r\n\r\nLaw Abiding Citizen is a riot, at its heart it does have something to say, even asking some pertinent questions. Do these social smarts come bursting through the bloody haze to make a point? No, they get submerged in a whirl of kinetic fury and socko violence, but they are there, caustically so. But hey!

            "review": "It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers. \r\n\r\nSo here it is, the 8th and final instalment of a film franchise that has lasted 10 years and runs at just under 20 hours in total. Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...\r\n\r\nDavid Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8/10"

That is until the next big release, where we will go around the houses again... \r\n\r\nOuija is just a standard boo-jump horror picture with a standard story line. Any expectation of any thing more would have (will do) led (lead) to great disappointment. It's one of those horror films that asks you to turn off the lights and just enjoy the quick spooky ride, then you get off the ride and quickly move on to something else. It's neither \"the worst horror film of all time\" or anything remotely original. It's Boo-Jump horror 101, so buy into that or leave it well alone. 6/10"

Go home._\r\n\r\n- _Rambo_ (2008); Wri. Art Monterastelli, Sylvester Stallone; Dir. Sylvester Stallone\r\n\r\nIn the torrent of negative reviews that greeted _Rambo: Last Blood_, one that stood out was Richard Roeper's zero-star rant for _The Chicago Sun Times_, in which he said of the film, \"_this is a gratuitously violent, shamelessly exploitative, gruesomely sadistic and utterly repellent piece of trash_\". I agree with pretty much all of that sentence. And I loved it. But let me segue into asking a question. Which is the more \"responsible\" - the hard R-rated movie that makes no bones about its violent content, or the equally violent PG-13 movie that gets around the issue by removing the gore but leaving the savagery? _Last Blood_ is only moderately more violent than the movies in the _Taken_ franchise, for example, but it's a damn-sight more honest in its depiction of the impact of violence on the human body. It's like the old joke about _The A-Team_ - it didn't matter what the level of violence was, the fact that we never saw blood and never saw anyone die meant it was family entertainment. _Last Blood_ is not family entertainment. Nor is it trying to be. Nor does it want to be. It's a throwback to a time before studios saw an R as a death-knell; a threadbare story leading to an extended action scene of ever-increasing ridiculousness and viciousness.\r\n\r\nAnd it's awesome.\r\n\r\nIn an age of political correctness, when almost everyone with a public voice is afraid to say anything that might earn them a ticking off, it's easy enough for a film to stand out, but only if the filmmaker has the balls to stand there relatively alone. S. Craig Zahler's superb _Dragged Across Concrete_ (2018) was a good recent example, an unashamedly trashy piece of exploitation that wasn't afraid to air opinions that could be considered (say it quietly) right-wing. Now, make no mistake, _Last Blood_ is no _Dragged Across Concrete_; it's barely a movie at all (the script is so rudimentary, it rivals the dizzying complexities of _Rocky IV_), and it's by far the least political entry in the _Rambo_ franchise thus far. Is it xenophobic? Yes. Is it racist? To a certain extent. Is it likely to stoke irrational fears about the evils of Mexico and permeability of the southern border? Possibly. What it definitely is, however, is a film in which Rambo doesn't just kill his enemies, he kills them several times just to be sure (like the unfortunate schmuck who is decapitated via close-range shotgun blast and then shot several times in the torso for punctuation). What it definitely is, is a film in which on no less than two occasions, Rambo uses his bare hands to extract internal organs. What it definitely is, is an immensely enjoyable no-holds-barred revenge actioner that's about as interested in political correctness as it is in millennial angst. Which is to say, not even remotely.\r\n\r\nAnd it's awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen last we saw former Green Beret John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), it was 2008, and he had returned to the US for the first time since 1985. Heading to his father's ranch in Bowie, Arizona, the implication was that maybe, after conflicts in Vi\u1ec7t Nam (twice), Afghanistan (where he fought alongside the Mujahideen), and Myanmar (where he faced off against the Tatmadaw), and an extended residency in Thailand, he had finally come home in both a literal and existential sense. _Last Blood_ picks up the story 11 years later. His father has died, but Rambo remains at the ranch, breaking in horses and taking medication to keep his PTSD partially under-control. He shares his home with live-in housekeeper Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her teenage granddaughter Gabriela (Yvette Monreal), who refers to him as uncle and who he helped to raise. All is quiet until Gabriela is contacted from Mexico by her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda), who tells her she has located Gabriela's father Manuel (Marco de la O), who walked out on her and her dying mother when she was still a child. Soon to be heading off to college, Gabriela is determined to look Manuel in the eye and ask why he left his family. Although advised by both Rambo and Maria not to go to Mexico, she ignores their warnings and heads south anyway. After Manuel proves as cruel as Rambo told her he was, she and Gizelle head out for a few drinks, but she is drugged and abducted by the Martinez brothers, Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (\u00d3scar Jaenada), who run a prostitution ring. Meanwhile, Rambo comes looking for her, but earns a beating for his troubles, only surviving because of the intervention of Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega), a local journalist investigating the Martinez cartel. And so, realising he can't fight the cartel on their territory and terms, Rambo decides to lure them back to Arizona, where he can fight them on his.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in David Morrell's superb 1972 novel, _First Blood_, the character of John Rambo was brought to the screen 10 years later, in the film of the same name, written by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Stallone, and directed by Ted Kotcheff. A Vi\u1ec7t Nam vet who finds himself unable to integrate back into a society that now hates him, he runs afoul of Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) in the small town of Hope, WA, against whom he wages a guerrilla war. One of many Vi\u1ec7t Nam-vet-comes-home-and-is-rejected-by-society films made in the years following the end of the Vi\u1ec7t Nam War (1955-1975), the character was praised as a particularly salient embodiment of the problems of unaddressed-PTSD. The novel ended with Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Trautman (played in the film by Richard Crenna) recognising that the man who came home from Vi\u1ec7t Nam could never be at peace in the US and shooting him dead in an act of mercy. The film was also supposed to end this way, but test audiences disliked the sense of nihilism with which they were left, and so a new ending was shot which saw Rambo arrested and imprisoned, but very much alive.\r\n\r\nOf course, Rambo hadn't been conceived as a muscle-bound action hero; Morell has always maintained the novel was a piece of social protest, and Stallone has spoken about how he thought of the film as the slightly more action-orientated, but equally serious, cousin of prestige dramas such as Hal Ashby's _Coming Home_ and Michael Cimino's _The Deer Hunter_ (both 1978). Nevertheless, it was the action elements of the film rather than the inherent tragedy of the character that audiences embraced, and for _Rambo: First Blood Part II_ (1985), written by Stallone and James Cameron, from a screen story by Kevin Jarre, and directed by George P. Cosmatos, Rambo took his first steps towards becoming a cartoon, as now the misunderstood vet who just wanted to be left alone was given a chance to return to Vi\u1ec7t Nam to fight the war the right way, rescuing undeclared POWs from the clutches of a Soviet/Vi\u1ec7t Nam conspiracy. With his actions in the second film earning him a pardon for his actions in the first, in _Rambo III_ (1988), written by Stallone and Sheldon Lettich, and directed by Peter MacDonald, things got even more ridiculous, as Rambo, now the embodiment of jingoistic Regan-era American militarism, was tasked with entering Afghanistan in the midst of the Soviet-Afghan War, where he would fight alongside the Mujahideen against the Soviet war machine. Finally, in _Rambo_ (2008), written by Art Monterastelli and Stallone, and directed by Stallone, Rambo must penetrate into Myanmar to rescue a group of Christian aid workers from the clutches of the Tatmadaw, an entire battalion of whom he massacres with a commandeered M2 Browning in a gloriously violent finale.\r\n\r\nUndeniably, for better or worse, the _Rambo_ films have always found a way to tap into some of the major geopolitical issues of the era in which they were made. The first film, made in the second year of Reagan's presidency, was a thoughtful and genuinely heartfelt plea for understanding, arguing that you can't create killing machines for use in a foreign war and then simply bring them home and expect them to reintegrate. Indeed, it's a film that's relatively uninterested in violence _per se_ (Rambo only indirectly kills one person, and it's an accident). The next two films also took place during Reagan's presidency, at a time when although the wounds of Vi\u1ec7t Nam were still fresh, the idea of American exceptionalism had started to morph into a kind of over-compensatory machismo. It was for this reason that the perceptive and justified seriousness of the first film became diluted as Rambo transitioned from being an allegory for the real struggles of vets to an embodiment of juvenile wish-fulfilment (I mean, in the second film, he literally gets a second crack at winning in Vi\u1ec7t Nam). In essence, he had transitioned from a symbol for the psychological damage of war to an undefeatable representative of American military might. The fourth film came out in the final year of George W. Bush's presidency at a time when the US (in no small part because of an illegal war) had once again risen to the position of global police force, although the fact that he's on a mission to save, of all things, Christian aid workers, is a bit on the nose even for this franchise. \r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _Last Blood_. Written by Stallone and Matthew Cirulnick, from a story by Dan Gordon, and directed by Adrian Grunberg (_Get the Gringo_), _Last Blood_, of course, comes in the fourth year of Donald Trump's presidency, and sees Rambo facing off against the bad _hombres_ south of the border (they bring drugs, they bring crime, they're rapists, although some, he assumes, are good people). And with a border this porous (characters easily cross over with weaponry, drugs, dead bodies, and, on one occasion, a decapitated head on the passenger seat), the only person who can protect the US of A from such villains is Don J. Trumpo...sorry, John J. Rambo. It's all gloriously juvenile, gloriously transparent, and gloriously entertaining.\r\n\r\nHowever, having said that, this is far and away the least political film of the franchise. Whilst the first and second both dealt explicitly with Vi\u1ec7t Nam, the third with the Soviet-Afghan war, and the fourth with the Myanmar Civil War, _Last Blood_ doesn't explicitly deal with a real-world conflict. It certainly alludes to real-world controversies, primarily issues related to the US-Mexican border, but it's not set in an inherently politicised _milieu_ the way the previous films have. And this ties into a crucial point \u2013 in moving out of the arena of politics, the storyline is more personal, which is important insofar as Rambo himself is presented somewhat differently this time, showing more emotion than we've seen from him since the opening few scenes of _First Blood_ (which Stallone has rightly pointed to as the last time we saw a vulnerable, very much human Rambo). This aspect of the film, in and of itself, is pretty fascinating, as it's also the only time since _First Blood_ where his PTSD has been so front-and-centre, as that element of his character was downplayed to the point of being virtually forgotten in the other three films. Here, not only is Rambo shown as still suffering the effects, he actually leans into it, using his trauma to motivate himself, essentially getting himself back into a Vi\u1ec7t Nam mindset, which is a pretty interesting way of presenting a character who has been rendered in simpler and simpler terms as the films have gone on. In this sense, the early parts of the film work extremely well from a psychological point of view \u2013 we see Rambo in a home, we see him trying to keep his demons at bay, we see him, for arguably the first time, with something to lose.\r\n\r\nHowever, for better or worse, the film's big selling point isn't the political allegory or the character's psychology \u2013 it's the action, the \"suit-up\" moment when Rambo unleashes hell. Here, the entire third-act is one long action scene, and it's entertaining enough to temper some of the political immaturity and distasteful stereotypes that lead up to it. Luring the Martinez cartel back to Arizona, Rambo hides out in a series of tunnels under the ranch, stalking and dispatching them one by one with simple, but vicious, man-made traps, in a scene that partly recalls his forest pursuit of Teasel and his men early in _First Blood_.\r\n\r\nWell shot by director Grunberg and cinematographer Brendan Galvin (_Veronica Guerin_; _Immortals_; _Self/less_), it's kind of the inverse of the sleek action scenes found in the _John Wick_ films - it's dark, gritty, and brutal, and whereas those films often create the impression of near weightlessness, here, it's the tangible physicality that works so well, the sense of visceral devastation that results from a particular impact rather than anything balletic. Editors Carsten Kurpanek (_Kickboxer: Vengeance_) and Todd E. Miller (_The Expendables 2_; _The Purge: Election Year_; _Mechanic: Resurrection_) also do terrific work here. Large portions of the scene take place in reasonably poorly lit underground tunnels, with very little to distinguish one location from another, so the fact that the grammar of the combat is so well maintained is a credit to them \u2013 you always know roughly where you are at any given moment, and never once did I find myself losing consciousness because of a flurry of incoherent edits (another problem with the _Taken_ films).\r\n\r\nOf course, a vital aspect of any Rambo movie is that a lot of what some people love will be the exact things that others despise. In this case, it's the laughably simplistic politics, the barely disguised xenophobia, the brutal violence, and the fetishisation of weaponry. On this last point, I can't recall, off the top of my head, another film which is so blatant in its glorification of guns, whether it's the long tracking shots of Rambo's collection of rifles, or the way the film lingers on the destruction they mete out. In short, this is the NRA's wet dream \u2013 an all-American hero dispensing biblical assault rifle-based vengeance on a bunch of greasy Mexican scumbags. Charlton Heston would be proud, bigly (yeah, I know, I'm mixing my right-wing references). \r\n\r\nThe film's handling of the Mexican portion of the story is also a good example of how you either decry the stupidity or celebrate the ridiculousness. The character of Gazelle, for example, dresses like the only research the costume department did was to watch Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez's _Stand and Deliver_ (1988) \u2013 she literally wears pleated khakis, a chequered blue and white shirt, dark lip-liner, and a bandana tied at the front. Similarly, poor Gabriela gets abducted after one night (count 'em, ONE night) in Mexico, where, apart from Carmen, every single character we meet is either in the cartel, involved in prostitution, or, in a lot of cases, both. And as for the aforementioned porousness of the border, I'm not sure if it's appallingly lazy writing or satirical genius, but Rambo (who at this point is carrying some questionable items) gets back into the US by simply finding a quiet section and ploughing his truck through the wire mesh fence (ignoring a sign warning against illegal crossings, because Rambo spits at signage). He wouldn't have been able to do that if there'd been a wall.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a criticism that I would treat a little more seriously is that although this is supposed to be the last chapter in the franchise, the script doesn't have any sense of finality. Nothing happens at any point where you could say to yourself, \"that seems a fitting send-off for the character\". From the generic and mainly faceless villains to the rote dialogue to the poorly constructed narrative beats, never at any point did this feel like a culmination. In fact, the previous film felt more final than this one does, as at least that one gave the character a degree of closure. And speaking of the script, much as _Rocky IV_ was two boxing matches loosely tied together by montages (including a montage in which Rocky thinks about montages), _Last Blood_ is 40 minutes of plot loosely connected to an extended action scene via, you guessed it, a series of montages.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be remiss of me not to mention David Morrell's opinion on the film. At one point, Morrell was actually working on a script for the film with Stallone, which he said gave Rambo a \"_soulful journey_\", and featured a \"_really emotional, powerful story_\". However, their draft was rejected in favour of an earlier idea which saw Rambo head to Mexico to rescue a young girl. Upon seeing the completed film, Morrell was far from impressed, writing on Twitter, \"_the film is a mess. Embarrassed to have my name associated with it_\", and later telling _Newsweek_,\r\n\r\n>_I felt degraded and dehumanised after I left the theatre. Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it, and today that's an unfortunate message._\r\n\r\nMake of that what you will.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, _Last Blood_ is a hilariously bad film. But it's also a hugely entertaining film. And sure, it continues a process which has seen a character who was once a representative for the nation's wounded psyche and just how dehumanising war can be, transition into an unstoppable jingoistic war machine. And sure, the violence is off the chart. And sure, the politics are hilariously na\u00efve at best, dangerously reductionist at worse, with Rambo coming to embody some of the current administration's most racist ideological arguments. But it's extremely well shot, Stallone gives a predictably strong performance, the action is intense, and, for me, none of the problems are so large as to render the film unenjoyable. Approach it with the right frame of mind, and you'll find much to appreciate."

The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a\r\nblockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original\r\nLone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking\r\naction fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. \r\n\r\nIt's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of\r\nyore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans\r\npulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the\r\nlandscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to\r\npast masters of the Western genre, while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona\r\nfide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. \r\n\r\nThis is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became\r\nThe Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian\r\nside-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom\r\nWilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain\r\nduties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West\r\nin is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for\r\neating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some\r\nGrindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with\r\nsexual energy. \r\n\r\nIt's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the\r\nexpense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could\r\nhave been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes,\r\nand Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary\r\na dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski\r\nthrow all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging\r\nfrom ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is\r\nbookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes\r\nfrom start to end. \r\n\r\nThere's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the\r\ntime, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and\r\nlegends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale.\r\nIt was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against\r\nthose damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being\r\nas he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer,\r\nHammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were\r\nwritten before the film had even been released, the big budget and\r\nproduction problems clearly making this a big stinker\u2026 \r\n\r\nNot so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into\r\nanachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it\r\nyet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a\r\nchance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It\r\nalso looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even\r\nshow Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10"

            "review": "With each new Marvel film one could expect the studio to push the limits of what a superhero film should consist of. Films such as Captain America: Winter Solider, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man all consisted of elements that we have never seen within a superhero film before. Now, Marvel Studios attempts to push the envelop once more by leaving the world of high tech armors and super soldiers and entering the mystical world of magic. Leading this charge is Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Stephen Strange and hopefully he could answer why there is this strange mystical feeling that we have seen this all before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> From Marvel comes \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place\u2014a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange\u2014armed with newly acquired magical powers\u2014is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.\r\n\r\nI am going to start off the review by discussing the only strong positive thing that came out of Doctor Strange and its by far the visuals. Beautiful vibrant colors pop at you throughout the film, the costume design is beyond extravagant and the framing is spot on. Doctor Strange and his fellow Sorcerers Supremes powers aren't fully on display until they enter the Mirror Dimension and my god, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner would hate this place. As they are men of science, they would hate that all rules of physics are thrown out the window as our Sorcerers Supremes are capable of breaking buildings apart and reforming to however they please. It is hard to not reference Inception but no one here is dreaming, these visuals are being created by the hand of mystical men and they use it to their power.\r\n\r\nIn all honestly, pushing the envelope when it comes to visuals was not a difficult task at all. Heck, if they didn't I would have been extremely disappointed as it was an obvious opportunity to take advantage of since we are dealing with magic. I am still extremely disappointed regardless as director Scott Derrickson completely missed another obvious opportunity to push the envelope this time in regards of character development.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stephen Strange is very much like a Tony Stark and other superheroes we have seen in films before as he is arrogant, egoistical and full of it. After Strange's accident in which he suffered extreme nerve damage to both hands, he dishes out every penny to his name to repair his hands in hopes he could continue his career as neurosurgeon. Every attempt fails and Strange becomes desperate enough to head to Nepal and finds himself under the guidance of Tilda Swinton's The Ancient One. Learning a whole new concept in the mystic arts forces Strange to reshape his way of thinking but Scott Derrickson does not let this have Strange reshape who he is as a person as well.\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange should have found himself being more like a Steve Rogers towards the end of the film as learning the mystic arts and his accident alone should have broken his ego. But instead everything still comes easy to him as he masters magic with ease with very little tension. He has a couple hiccups in the beginning but once The Ancient One puts him under her wing it is smooth sailing and Strange is stealing texts, wielding powerful weapons and defeating Supremes with decades of training with ease.\r\n\r\nYou cannot say that Strange was destined for the mystic arts and that is why everything came so easy for him. Strange is only learning the mystic arts due to circumstance. If he doesn't get into an accident, which happened to him due to being careless, he doesn't find himself in Nepal. Harry Potter was destined for magic, not Strange. Strange fails to grow as a character because he continues to be proven right and no consequences seem to happen due to his actions.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get into the character development of our supporting characters Benedict Wong's Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo as I would utterly spoil the film for you. All I would say though is that they were both mishandled and deserved better developments. It is a shame too because Wong and Ejiofor are superb actors but wasting talent is something Marvel Studios is used to.\r\n\r\nWhen will Marvel Studios get a villain right?  With Mads Mikkelsen playing our lead villain, Kaecilius, I thought we might finally get a cinematic Marvel villain that is on par to Killgrave and Kingpin over at Marvel's television department. Ultimately, Kaecilius and Doctor Strange end up fighting due to the most silliest cliche: being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The two individuals meet at the New York Sanctum Sanctorum in which Strange accidentally gets blown in to. Kaecilius is there to kill the protector and Sanctum Sanctorum itself and has no knowledge of who Strange is. In fact, he honestly believes Strange's name is in fact \"Mister Doctor.\" Still learning his craft, Strange is capable of putting up a better fight than the protector who should be a matter. I mean, he is a protector after all. There are no stakes for Strange, strange.\r\n\r\nVisually appealing could only get you so far as Doctor Strange fails to focus on the development of their characters that they made so appealing to the eye. Doctor Strange will become a huge asset to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and lets hope we see the rest of Strange's development when he casts his next spell. There is so much untapped potential in Strange's character, we just haven't seen the best of him yet."

I had no clue concerning this movie until we watched it. It turned out be an enjoyable movie evening. This is a well done movie indeed although I felt like it could have been an even better movie at the end.\r\n\r\nActing, scenery, general story is all quite good. Well the story is okay. It is not exactly ground breaking but rather a standard bootlegging kind of story. The new deputy is a real asshole to the extent of being somewhat unbelievable. Guy Pearce plays the role well though. That goes for the rest of the main cast as well. It is a well-acted movie.\r\n\r\nIt kind of drags on a bit though. The real action where they finally take on the asshole deputy is not until the very end of the movie. Okay, that is perhaps understandable but until then the movie is quite slow. I would not have minded to see both the older Bondurant brothers being a bit more into the action but instead we mostly follow Jack (Shia LaBeouf) on his various more or less silly escapades and romantic adventures which, not very surprisingly, ends up with him leading previously mentioned asshole deputy right to their illegal booze factory\u2026sigh! I am not 100% convinced that you can survive having your throat cut by the way. I think that was rather silly.\r\n\r\nIt is a good movie and of a lot higher quality than most although perhaps not exactly my style of movie and I have to say that I thought the ending, with Forrest blundering into the frozen lake, was rather meh. Still, it is worth 6 out o10 stars but not more as far as I am concerned."

Even after delivering the hard-hitting\u00a0Whiplash\u00a0and the emotionally-wrecking and whimsical\u00a0La La Land, he still knows how to surprise fans of his work, returning to the silver screen with grace. Combining every element of his previous outings that made him a household name, Chazelle makes sure the audience feels every ounce of power that he's thrown into his latest directorial effort. Oddly enough, it's his first foray into biopic\u00a0territory, a zone where many revered filmmakers have failed to capture the reality of the moment they're attempting to bring to life.\r\n\r\nGoing in, you'll already know how the movie ends, which is the problem most directors encounter when making a biopic. Finding a way to transfer the actuality of the moment while still feeling original and never appearing boring is a hard task that very few have been able to truly accomplish. With First Man, Chazelle manages to land a spot on that list of directors,\u00a0and for good reason. He keeps true to the true story with a film that's so intense and fully realized that you might forget that it actually happened.\r\n\r\nSpace movies have always been a highlight of cinema. From Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' 1902 silent film\u00a0A Trip to the Moon\u00a0and Stanley Kubrick's\u00a02001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0to the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0and\u00a0Alien\u00a0franchises, films taking place in the farthest reaches of the universe prove to be some of the most intriguing and original creations brought to viewers' eyes (even by today's standards). It's the true stories that really prove to be some of the most effective, however. Sure, fictional ones show us what could be possible; but it's the depictions of true events that show us what\u00a0was\u00a0possible, creating a harrowing story of patriotism in the process.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective,\u00a0First Man\u00a0is a marvel on all fronts. Linus Sandgren, the cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on\u00a0La La Land, returns to collaborate with Chazelle and once again delivers a grand spectacle that should not be missed out on while in theaters. The cinematography is stunning. Hues of yellow and blue pop, lighting a path towards the characters and showing no sign of stopping once they've started. Certain scenes are given an extra boost from the home-video-style camerawork, beautifully grainy and shaky in all of the right ways.\r\n\r\nJustin Hurwitz (Chazelle's roommate in college), another frequent collaborator, also returns to score the film and knocks it out of the park as expected. Hurwitz obviously knows how to write music, but its how his compositions fit in with the scenes and themes they're tied to that make them so worthwhile. Hurwitz invests you in the midst of all the chaos with all of the orchestral beauty surrounding his pieces. That's the thing about his scores, though: it's hard to objectively rank them because of how different they all are. Chazelle is a unique director because he never sticks to the same formula over an over again, and the same can be said for the accompanying music for each of them.\r\n\r\nActing is on point here; Ryan Gosling hits a huge emotional nerve with incredibly investing performance as Neil Armstrong. He keeps to himself (namely, his personal life) but is willing to risk it all for the mission. Nothing from Gosling is single-layered; everything is complex and detailed to the point that you might as well be in the room with him.\r\n\r\nClaire Foy also delivers an amazing portrayal as Janet Armstrong, Neil's wife. Foy topples every housewife stereotype that embodied this specific time period, giving a strong, contained, and free-willed performance of a woman who is certainly not afraid to share her thoughts on issues concerning her husband.\r\n\r\nThe flag controversy is totally stupid. The moon landing scene doesn't need the image of Armstrong planting the flag on the moon to dish up a heavily emotional response from the audience. If you get a chance to screen it in IMAX, definitely do. The expanded aspect ratio only comes into play during this specific scene but it is utterly transfixing.\r\n\r\nFirst Man\u00a0is one of the best films of the year, no doubt about it. Every shot is perfection. Every sound is excellence. There is no comparison to what Damien Chazelle and co. have accomplished here; even iconic films like\u00a0Apollo 13\u00a0can't live up to the new bar of quality Chazelle has set for the space drama subgenre.\u00a0A harrowing journey from start-to-finish, and a true masterwork in many respects,\u00a0First Man\u00a0is one film that delivers upon its promise and then some. Performances and technicalities are perfect, but that's what Chazelle will continue to be known for: perfection."

It stars Colin Farrell, David Thewlis, Ray Winstone, Ben Chaplin, Keira Knightley and Anna Friel. Music is by Sergio Pizzorno and cinematography by Chris Menges.\r\n\r\nAfter serving his stretch for GBH, Harry Mitchel (Farrell) returns to his manor and finds gangland boss Rob Gant (Winstone) wants him as one of his charges.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by the man who co-wrote The Departed, it's not hard to guess what sort of tone London Boulevard is set at. Which for anyone who follows neo-noir will find plenty to like here, not least the stylish and tonally compliant photography of Menges.\r\n\r\nHowever, falling under the neo-noir banner becomes a curse in a way because there are far greater films of this ilk to liken it too. Pic at least does have the courage to not cop out in resolutions, but again there is no surprise factor for the genre faithfuls.\r\n\r\nThe narrative often meanders, shoehorning in Knightley's (underused) harassed actress as a love interest in the process, and London accents are choppy. It also is criminal to have Stephen Graham and Eddie Marsan in your movie and barely give them screen time!\r\n\r\nOn the plus side of things, the violence and dialogue is often taut and tart respectively, backed by a scorching rocky hipster soundtrack. Farrell is good value as a tough guy, Winstone does what he does best, menacing of course, while Thewlis steals the film as a wired cool cat with menace surprisingly lurking in is heart.\r\n\r\nAs a whole it fails to hit all the right spots, but enough in here for neo-noir fans to feed on as an appetiser to a more fulfilling noir meal. 6/10"

Edgar Wright knows how to stage exciting comedies and The World's End made me laugh (Gary's confidence in the beginning, the boys arguing over the term robot, Martin Freeman with a football head, and so on and so forth.) But more importantly, it showed me what a great comedy with a clear point of view looks like. Specifically, it made me think not just about the end of the world, but about nostalgia's dark side and the things people put in their way to numb what they don't like in their present. Check out Simon Pegg's performance, which shows some powerfully realistic pathos behind the funny screw-up that Gary is."

A favour for a favour to get justice seems viable, but all is not as it seems...\r\n\r\nTo be frank it's just another in a long line of vigilante thrillers that get trundled out every other year. Rarely does one, certainly in the more modern era of film making, have something viable to say, to challenge the thought process of the viewers. Justice (AKA: Seeking Justice) starts off very promising, grabbing the attention whilst having an atmospheric texture about it. Sadly come the mid-point things just get daft (yet Cage stays ultra serious throughout) and in spite of the makers trying to add in some twisty thriller conventions, all the potential (and promise) for thought provoking depth has long since gone.\r\n\r\nThat said, as an intrigue based drama it's a decent enough watch, with director Roger Donaldson (No Way Out/Thirteen Days) adept in the staging of suspenseful sequences. Yet the lack of kinetic action is sorely felt, the over all feeling being one that Donaldson and crew were not quite sure which way to take the picture. Should we keep things shadowy and suggestive? Or should we have live wire chases and dastardly peril? Justice only winds up as an uneven blend of ideas. While wasting Xander Berkeley and the New Orleans locations is a crime in itself.\r\n\r\nNot bad exactly, above average in fact, but just forgettable and another wasted opportunity to add meat to a hot topic in film form. 6/10"

It was enjoyable sure, and had some good morals and family values but I never felt like I was invested in the main characters. Stuff just seemed to happen.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and this isn't as much the movies fault as perhaps the marketing that surrounded it, but it was actually a very different movie than I thought it was going to be. I discovered that it's hard to break those pre-conceptions as I kept thinking the story was going somewhere else than it did.\r\n\r\nBrave was at its best when it made me laugh which  unfortunately, was just too seldom. For example, the entire scene where the 3 clans try to fight for M\u00e9rida's hand was way too short!\r\n\r\nThe voice cast was very good though. Kelly Macdonald in particular, was perfect as M\u00e9rida.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Brave was good but not great. It just seems to lack the \"magic\" I expect from Pixar. Not their worst outing but close to it."

The prospect of of reliving those tragic (even if heroic) deaths is too painful for me.  \r\n\r\nAnd yet, give me an alien invasion and I'm \"all up in that\".  \r\nI find the fantasy of war exciting, and yet I have to be aware of how such films glorify violence; glorify war.  I'm conflicted, enjoying this guilty pleasure.   \r\n\r\nI'm a little surprised by the low rating.  \r\nHave there been too many movies of this sort? a burnout by the viewing public?  A burnout - when it comes to war?  Another sign that we might be a war-weary nation / world?\r\n\r\nAs for me, I don't watch a lot of flicks, so I'm not \"burnt out\" when it comes to military action films.  So, this was not \"same-o, same-o\" for me.  \r\n\r\nI thought the script was impressively tight.  That applies to character development as well; quick snap-shot profiles; a glance, a nod and you had pretty much all you needed to know about this or that character.  \r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the \"shaky-cam\", but I thought it was well employed in some of the battle scenes.  I've never been in such a situation, but I think the camera gave us that sense of heart-pounding, out of control terror that being shot at and bombed can produce; often no knowing even where the fire is coming from as you hunker down and question your very soul.  \r\n\r\nYes, this is a familiar theme - seasoned tough old lifer in charge of a bunch of kids - typical of many such films (Heartbreak Ridge comes to mind; many more).  \r\n\r\nI wonder, also, if there is more of a connection with military vets; something the civilian population can never really get (no offense; just fact; I served but never got shot at)? \r\nFrom my experience, I thought the military portrayal was pretty spot on (military gear, tactics, fallibility, rank, age differences, rancor, \"I got your 6\", sense of duty and dedication to mission; never give up, never surrender).  \r\n\r\nPredictable formula script?  sure, in some ways, but I found plenty of surprises as well.  \r\nMaybe if I watched this sort of film all the time, I'd be as cynical as many here.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this film (gave it 8/10; probably would have given it 7 1/2, but it deserves better than what I see others giving it).  \r\n\r\nRecent revelations from sources such Bigelow and Elizondo, have all but confirmed that we are being visited by aliens.  And, who knows, maybe they will decide to harvest our water before we contaminate it any further, as we creep and crawl closer and closer to our own nuclear annihilation."

With that I aside, I went to see it with willingness to give it the benefit of the doubt. \"Ghost in the Shell\" is well...a beautiful shell. \r\n\r\nThe visuals were absolutely breath taking. The action scenes flowed so beautifully with special effects. But that's all the movie had to offer. Take away the spectacles and you have a basic run-of-the-mill action movie. \r\n\r\nThe acting was fine. But honestly, the leads didn't have anything to actually sink their teeth into. Scarjo, and everyone else, was serviceable. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some mindless, yet stunning entertainment, then go see it."
