Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks\u2014advised by his brilliant VP and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor\u2014makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.",

I like the cast, while the songs are alright - if cringey. Everything else is either slow, predictable or straight up boring. It might've, perhaps, worked better as a flat out drama - though then they'd get hate for changing things, I guess.\r\n\r\nAs noted, the onscreen talent stopped this from falling far down my ratings. Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne are two actors I enjoy, I found them satisfactory in this - could've been better, could've been worse. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis is more than decent in the lead, while David Zayas is solid.\r\n\r\nCameron Diaz is, however, truly awful - and that's coming from someone who likes Diaz; she's very good in films like <em>'Shrek'</em>, <em>'Knight and Day'</em> and <em>'Bad Teacher'</em> but this is certainly the worst I've seen from her - it's a shame that she went out with this as well as the dreadful and overall inferior <em>'Sex Tape'</em>.\r\n\r\nDespite me rating (most of) the cast themselves, I don't think the casting itself is anything praisable. Foxx, Byrne and Diaz are not three actors I'd immediately think of if I was making a musical - a few of their songs are a tad ropey.\r\n\r\nPoor, all in all."

The film was really brilliant despite the influence of plenty of other films. Yes, the ideas were borrowed from the movies like 'Short Circuit', 'I, Robot', 'RoboCop', Real Steel', \"Bicentennial Man', 'Transcendence', et cetera. But that did not bother me at all. I would call it an inspiration to make a new product out that already existed.\r\n\r\nIt was not completely depended on Dev Patel's role, otherwise woulda been a disaster. Its the Hugh Jackman, eventhough his character was not on the frontline, because of his presence, the movie was filled with some exciting and thrilling moment. His role was pretty much same to 'Real Steal', but showed in a different shade.\r\n\r\nSilly concept, even dialogues were so stupid. I don't know, maybe because of the South African accent. But the screenplay was very good. Fast and gets the point quickly than wasting time for buildups. One of the best robot movie and it will be remembered. Looks like the sequel will be more furious and going to be an action packed item, if there will be one. Worth to watch it at least once.\r\n\r\n7.5/10"

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"

            "review": "Dhoom 3 is the third of the well acclaimed blockbuster \"Dhoom\" action series. The movie stars renowned Bollywood stars Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan in a legendary battle between a vigilante and a no-nonsense policeman. The film opens in the 1990\u2019s to a show known as The Great Indian Circus. The show starred flashy dancers, dangerous stunts and most importantly a young magician established as the Iqbal Khan\u2019s (the owner) son Sahir.  The show was under a great deal of pressure from its lender as it was unable to make payments on its loan.  Per the banker\u2019s demand, the show was ordered to be shut down and Iqbal Khan committed suicide immediately.\r\n\tThe film then fast forwards to present day, Sahir (Aamir Khan) is an adult and has formulated a plot to avenge his father\u2019s death by planning and executing robberies against the bank that once closed his father\u2019s circus. After one robbery, ACP Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) is summoned on the case. After a case of cat and mouse, epic chase scenes, and another robbery Jai learns the truth behind Sahir\u2019s robberies. An epic plot twist reveals that Sahir is actually a twin to his autistic brother Samar which explains the inherit \u201cmagic\u201d behind Sahir\u2019s avoiding the police during the chase. Undercover police work and a fifteen minute police chase later the film fittingly ends when Sahir and Samar apparently commit suicide by jumping off a bridge much like their father did. The film lives up to the hype led by the precursor movies in the series, giving the viewers epic action scenes, major plot twists and countless dance numbers that Bollywood film patrons love so much. \r\n   This action film has same intrinsic values and plot as the iconic film Deewaar. The motives of both Sahir and Vijay can be ascribed to the underlying resentment and anger of  young men, or the proverbial \u201cangry young man\u201d made so famous by Deewar\u2019s leading man, Amitabh Bachchan. The young men both took it upon themselves to seek their own justice against what they deemed was unfair and unjust to their family. Both films stress the increased importance on family values that one would see in any other typical megahit Bollywood film. The basic plot of Dhoom 3 is the revenge of the twin sons against the bank for being the cause of their father's death, albeit indirectly.  In Deewaar, Vijay\u2019s father is victimized by a corrupt businessman and leaves town, leaving the family to fend for themselves, and Vijay spends his formative teen years and early adulthood fighting for his rights.  The impact of the victimization of the fathers on the children was evident in both films. The endings are also both inherently tragic as both angry young men die in pursuit of their own justices because they operated outside the law. Historically, in Bollywood rivalries and traditions are multi-generational and these two movies are no exceptions. \u201c[Vijay]\u2026 unlike hard core villains, values family relationships\u2026 he is an exemplary older brother (as a child he worked so hard so that his brother could be educated\u201d (Thomas). In both films the villain is not one true villain but rather someone who is fighting for their own justice having experienced one in the past. \u201c\u2026 he [Vijay] is also good enough to be the focal hero\u201d (Thomas). This runs a direct parallel to Sahir as the triumph of the law (Abhishek Bachchan) over the criminal (Aamir Khan), even if the crime is strangely understandable and maybe justifiable.  There have been rumors of Dhoom 4 and a potential leading villain role of Shah Rukh Khan as well.  We will just have to wait and see."

A biographical drama of a British woman who had played an important role in many middle-eastern affairs during the early 1900s. After the tragic death of the man she was madly in love, the young Gertrude Bell decides to travel across the middle-east to write about it and to do some archaeological research and other stuffs. After the decades of travel on all the corners of the region, what she achieved was the film disclosed in an inspiring way.\r\n\r\nI love this director's films and filmmaking style. It is his first time since last 6 years, but not good as I expected. It is a bit of both, documentary and feature film. Awesomely shot, I loved the camera work and actors too did so well. Nicole Kidman was brilliant, might be her best for portraying in a real life character. Yet something was missing from the film. Maybe the film came at the wrong time, should have been made at least 15 years ago. Otherwise, it is an Oscar worthy product.\r\n\r\nThis film is worth watching for the beautiful desert landscapes and obviously for Kidman. The issue with the story is the focus which completely relied on Kidman's role. She was everywhere and leaving blank on the other end. Something like showing what she accomplished was the notion, so in perspective, it could have made a better documentary film. Some people might like it, especially if you're from the middle-east. But don't expect I would recommend it, because I won't. Whatever I said the film was not bad, just a 50-50 kind.\r\n\r\n5/10"

The movie? Well to me the movie was a rather mediocre one. As the blurb states the story is set in a dystopian future but we do not really get to know how they got there except the standard explanation that \u201cthere was a war\u201d. The world is a bizarre mixture of primitive post-apocalypse living and modern, futuristic tech. The division of people into factions\u2026well to me it felt pretty dumb to begin with and the idea that some people could not possibly fit into more than one faction was absolutely ludicrous to me. How the hell was it supposed to keep peace by deliberately factioning people against each other?\r\n\r\nOkay, trying to get over these gripes, what about the rest of the movie. Well it was okayish I guess. It did give me the same feeling as when reading a young-adult book and I would say that this movie is most suitable for a younger audience. The story is rather predictable. There is the initial training part where Tris of course gets a few friends and in particular befriends one of her tutors. Not surprisingly there is also the obligatory jerk. The one thing that makes the movie a bit out of the ordinary are the induced dream sequences which are not too bad.\r\n\r\nLater in the movie Tris starts to discover the plot of the bad guys and of course goes off to save the day. Again these part are simple and predictable. The ease by which Tris and a few of her friends manages to infiltrate the lab/headquarters of the baddies is rather unbelievable. It of course helps that it seems like it is only the good guys who can shoot straight or fight worth a damned with a few occasional exceptions when the script calls for it.\r\n\r\nThe movie is, as far as I understand it, based only on the first book in the trilogy so it is perhaps not very surprising that it ends with a lot of loose ends but, for Christ sake, they fight their way to stop the plot, taking down a lot of people on their way, and then they leave the chief mastermind of this despicable plot lying unconscious but alive on the floor just taking off. That just felt dumb!\r\n\r\nIt is not a bad bad movie but I do not understand the high ratings some people seem to give it."

There's only one catch - he didn't write it. As the past comes back to haunt him and his literary star continues to rise, Jansen is forced to confront the steep price that must be paid for stealing another man's work, and for placing ambition and success above life's most fundamental three words.",

But, don't expect anything more than a *standard military action movie* with cliched dialogue, unreasonable scenarios, and mediocre acting. \r\n\r\nThis movie could have been decent, if the producers and script-writers had only spent some time researching facts about how the military and special forces work IRL. Instead, they decided to throw reality to the wind and use fantasy & make-believe to create contrived conveniences to support a predictable storyline. I don't mind when a movie asks me to suspend belief a little. But, this one asks us to leave all rational thinking at the door. \r\n\r\nIt's __just__ interesting enough that you'll stay with it, mostly because you think it might get better. __Sadly, it doesn't__."

That's where everyone's are wrong and expresses their disappointment. For me it was a nice comedy, but not comparable with other great ones. It might won't work on teenagers, but there's no issue for adults with the open mind to enjoy it. A part themed movie for the grown-ups.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Pitch Perfect' another woman oriented comedy. Both, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were not that funny, hence not a rocking combo, but did not fail either and worked okay on this. They are the sisters with the opposite character. When they visit their childhood home, they decide to throw one final party before handing it over to the new owners.\r\n\r\nJohn Cena's cameo was excellent. In this chick movie he's the only one who gave manly appeal compared with the other men. The story was decent, but most of the movie was a regular party that goes wild. So expecting development of the characters or the story is silly. What I meant was, it is an entertainer, not a biopic or a documentary, so it delivers its purpose.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "America, mid-nineteenth century, just prior to the Civil War. Winter. Two horsebacked slave-traders are leading half-a-dozen manacled negro slaves through a large, unspecified section of Texas. As they move one night through a wood, they cross paths with an affable, charming German fellow identified by the hokey model tooth affixed atop his carriage by a spring as a travelling dentist. He greets the traders cordially but he's struggling to be understood; not because English is his second language (although he deferentially concedes as much when instructed - more than once - to \"Speak English!\") but because his vocabulary is far wider than that of the simpler men here before him. It's not a chance passing, either; this German fellow, who identifies himself as Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling, deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds) is looking for these traders. More specifically, their inventory of negro slaves. Even more specifically, one of those slaves in particular. Django (Jamie Foxx, Collateral, Ray). Attempting to buy Django, Schultz is met with short, suspicious shrift and ordered at gunpoint to be on his way. Within a second, one trader lies dead and the other lies incapacitated underneath the bulk of his dead horse. Schultz unchains Django, instructs Django to take the dead fellow's horse and coat, and pays the remaining trader for all that he's taken. He then tosses the manacle key to the other slaves and posits two choices to them, as he sees it: Carry their injured master thirty-plus miles to the nearest town for medical assistance, or unchain themselves, blow the injured slave-trader's head off with the gun Shultz has left them, bury the corpses and use the Pole Star to run for the Northern states, where slavery had been abolished, and for more than fifty years in some areas. Funnily enough, they take up the latter option.\r\n\r\nSo begins Django Unchained, an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by Gen-X movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino. Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western, he's finally made one himself, and if Quentin's your thing it's a blast, though I doubt it'll convert many Tarantino sceptics; in fact it'll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him, about which more later.\r\n\r\nIt transpires that Dr. Schultz ISN'T a dentist (\"I haven't practised dentistry in five years,\" he confides to Django over a beer) but a bounty hunter, and a lethal one at that. He's chasing down the Brittles, a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers. He doesn't know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation, which is why he was searching for Django - a slave recently sold by that very plantation - in the first place; Django can point them out for him. Schultz is no fan of the South's backwards-thinking propensity for slavery though, and he offers Django a deal: help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz will treat Django like a free man, pay him $75 (a decent little wedge in 1858) and rubber-stamp his freedom. Along the way, he'll also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bounty-hunting (both in which Django proves to be a natural). On the trail of the Brittles, Schultz wonders aloud as to Django's plans once this endeavour is over and he's free. Well, as it happens, Django is a married man and his intention, once free, is to find his wife and buy her freedom. They'd tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but they'd been caught, branded (both Django and his wife - played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington - sport R-For-Runaway scars on their cheeks) and sold on, separately. So he doesn't know where she is but that's what he's going to try to do. Schultz, feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom, proposes a further deal: If this Brittle bounty goes well, he'll honour Django's freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners, taking on bounties and earning money, he'll help Django locate his wife.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a large sequence of set-pieces - some funny, some tense, some action-packed - stretched across very-nearly three hours (though, like most QT films, it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly) strung together by a fairly simple revenge/rescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop; a reasonably similar template to many of Quentin's movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds, to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings. Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be, and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie, a contained set-piece all of its own. Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues - rambling shaggy-dog stories, usually - to one another, for context. Not every scene is entirely necessary, either. I wouldn't call that a flaw though, I'd call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino; whether it's a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether that's an element of Tarantino's writing that the viewer appreciates. Personally, I love Tarantino's writer's voice and I could watch these scenes for hours (indeed, I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday), but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90-minute film that's lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are saying.\r\n\r\nPerformances throughout are utterly mesmerising, from stars Foxx and Waltz but also - in fact, maybe more so - from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as \"Monsieur\" Calvin Candie, the horrifying owner of the \"Candyland\" plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Django's wife, and Samuel L. Jackson in an if-anything even more monstrous role as Stephen, Candie's elderly head house slave, a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slave-in-chief. Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy, a strutting, peacock-like Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers, and delightful in cameo roles are (among many others) James Remar (The Warriors, Dexter), Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Watch), John Jarratt (Wolf Creek, Rogue) and Michael Parks (Red State, Kill Bill). Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and, as usual, he's not as charming as he probably thinks he is, but he's also not as bad as many think he is, either. There's even a quick cameo (raising an involuntary cheer from me!) by Franco Nero, the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci (that's not the only nod back to the first Django movie; the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original, and the theme song to Quentin's film comes directly from the Corbucci film too).\r\n\r\nDjango Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts; possibly for it's incredible levels of bloodshed (one particular gunfight is the most blood-splattered scene I've seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining), and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as \"The 'N'-word\", uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last. However, neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion. The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality. Heads, arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy, \"BLAAAPP!\" sound effect, the blood itself translucent, syrupy and intentionally unrealistic. And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South, you're going to hear the word \"Nigger\" in that tale. Often. Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans, this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic, pig-ignorant white overseers.\r\n\r\nIf you like Tarantino, you'll probably like Django Unchained. If you like Westerns (and the blood-drenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular), you'll probably like Django Unchained. If, like me, you're an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns, this is a no-brainer. Get and see it, it's a blast.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have seen him pull a Gatling gun out of a coffin, though."

Even the end of the movie contributes to the concept.\r\n\r\nBringing Leven Rambin (Sarah Connor Chronicles) on as Clarisse is a refreshing way to breathe life into the sequel, but she's not in the focus of the movie.  Bringing Alexandra Daddario back was a good choice, but she seemed incredibly under utilized, like a worse version of Ron Weasley, just a body there, but maybe they'll kiss.  Brandon T. Jackson is in and out of the movie focus, so he's only able to do so much to help the movie.  Jake Abel (Hunger Games) is back, but as a villain, so while he does a decent job, it's limited.\r\n\r\nI think after the first movie, they impressed upon Logan Lerman to carry more of the weight of the movie, and let him share the load with Douglas Smith, but while they complimented each other, it's bland complimenting bland.  And it's not they the did a bad job, they just didn't do the great job needed for this movie to really stand out.\r\n\r\nWhile I think there is an enjoyable movie here, you're not missing anything by skipping it, or re-watching the original."

We watch them in action via a number of set pieces, and see that they're cynical enough to interpret the rules as necessary but still by a long, long stretch good and decent cops that will risk their lives in carrying out their duties at a moment's notice. Zavala is already blissfully happily married with a baby on the way, Taylor has just met a sweet Irish gal and over the course of the film we see their relationship blossom and grow. These two men are like the closest of brothers. It's all good to see. One day, their dedication to the job causes them to stumble in over their pay grade into a much larger drug cartel and human trafficking operation than regular beat cops would usually encounter. Homeland Security agents appear, having apparently already been monitoring the situation, and warn our boys that they've bloodied the wrong noses, and they'd better lay low.\r\n\r\nI HATE a dumb actioner, and this ain't that. Well, it DOES contain all of the standard tropes and cliches (buddy cops, stumbling in over their heads into some drug cartel hoo-haa; the bad guys all being relentlessly bad 24/7, permanently scowling, growling and barking at one another, etc.), but done ever-so-well; reminiscent to me of how [REC] didn't contain anything new or fresh whatsoever, but did all of what it did very well indeed and it came across as fresh as a result.\r\n\r\nIt's shot mostly cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style, utilising a plotline in which officer Taylor is shooting a documentary piece for a student course he's taking. However, it switches between between first and third-person narrative a la Modern Family, but when it switches to third-person it retains a very documentary-like feel, so it all feels quite seamless.\r\n\r\nIt wilts a little just past the halfway mark but picks up enormously for the final third. Also, when it's violent (which isn't often), it's unexpectedly VERY violent.\r\n\r\nI'd give it an 8/10 and recommend that it's worth at least a look. And I'm not a fan of L.A. guns/bloods/crips/gangs/urban/drugs/cops films."

Good acting\u2026nope. Intelligent and intriguing plot\u2026absolutely not. Zombies\u2026yep. Action\u2026most definitely yes! Anything else\u2026well if you\u2019re member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.\r\n\r\nNow that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.\r\n\r\nI think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvellous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I\u2019m hardly among the younger part f the mail audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill\u2019s chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like \u201cdid you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards\u201d.\r\n\r\nI cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed myself a lot while watching it. The ending is the usual video-game-movie cliff-hanger and I really hope they make another sequel now when Alice got her powers back. That she lost those was one of the big downers for me in one of the previous movies in the franchise."

            "review": "In the raucous and woefully wretched **Dirty Grandpa** director Dan Mazer's lazy and lethargic laugher gives a whole new meaning to the term \"gag comedy\" with the emphasis on the word gag. One might want to upchuck at this mindless ragtag romp that desperately tries too hard to reel in the obnoxious chuckles. Undoubtedly toothless, unimaginative, and aimlessly insipid the degenerative **Dirty Grandpa** has all the cheeky charm and hilarity as a waxy floor in an arthritic nursing home patient's dim lit room.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the questionable punchline to this foolish and crass joke-of-a-movie is why a prestigious performer of Oscar-winner Robert DeNiro's caliber doing such silly and offensive sludge as the flatulent farce **Dirty Grandpa** in the first place? Sure, DeNiro has done his share of hit-and-miss comedies in his career as well as some dramas that were lackluster and forgettable. It is true...even the great cinematic icons can gravitate to the usual duds from time to time. However, watching the intense and revered seventy-something veteran DeNiro wallow in this madcap mess is utterly inexcusable. What even possessed DeNiro to appear in such a diaper rash of a juvenile comedy? Did he lose a bet or was challenged to a dare of some awful kind?\r\n\r\nAs for DeNiro's co-star in ex-Disney Channel dreamboat star Zac Efron one can not be hardly surprised that the big screen boytoy as popped up in this train wreck of a treat seeing as though Efron's past film choices have not been what one might call consistently stellar in his film career thus far. Let's face it...**Dirty Grandpa** was begging for a tongue-lashing and rightfully so. Unless you are an uncontrollable hormonal teen with a locker room mentality attached to your blank psyche then one might find the witless **Dirty Grandpa** a bombastic bore that could not clean up its noxious act even if it ran through several durable car washes.  \r\n\r\nScreenwriter John Phillips wants to present DeNiro's crusty curmudgeon Dick Kelly as a walking wrecking ball with no filter whatsoever. In fact, DeNiro's Dick Kelly is a tragic figure that could be misunderstood by some and mistrusted by others. It appears that Dick Kelly is the cursed clown with the wounded soul--no doubt Phillips's ridiculed target for the inside satirical look at aging hardcore has-beens that rail against a world they no longer recognize and allowed to pass them by in the process. **Dirty Grandpa** could have been a dark and impish commentary on maturing quiet rage with snarling senior citizen Dick Kelly's ignorance serving as a red button for panic. Unfortunately for the throwaway **Dirty Grampa** it is not clever or calculating enough to realize its potential as a subversive chuckler while simple resting its guffaws on cheap-minded edgy banality. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, recent widower Dick Kelly wants to unwind in the aftermath of his wife's passing and head down to Florida where he and his late beloved bride spent their treasured days near their summer home. This means enlisting the assistance of his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to accompany him to the Sunshine State so that Dick can get loose and wild. \r\n\r\nDick, a retired military man, is not a Golden-Aged Boy Scout by any means. He is indeed a Dirty Grandpa based on his persona as a bombastic bastard of a character. Dick is a proud-minded racist, misogynist and homophobe...and these are his good qualities! Dick is indignant as he incredulously wonders why he cannot utter the N-word and does not miss a beat when drooling over the bouncy babes that could easily pass for his granddaughters. And Dick has his \"gaydar\" gander up when confronted with \"swishy guys\" in his presence. Also, there is no shame whenever Dick feels free to...um, pleasure himself regardless of whether Jason is in the vicinity or not. Dick, to say the least, is a tool in the worst way. \r\n\r\nNaturally, **Dirty Grandpa** eagerly wants to throw into the sordid mix other wacked-out characterizations to add to the clumsy raunchfest. Both Mazer and Phillips get their junk food jollies in presenting supporting players that gleefully reinforce all the staged nuttiness at hand. There is a curious slutty siren (Aubrey Plaza from TV's \"Parks and Recreation\") that wants to \"do the naughty\" with Dick to satisfy her fetish for pleasuring old geezers. And then there is Jason's galpal (Julianne Hough) that seriously needs a stick removed from her no-nonsense butt before she ties the knot. Of course this dumb display tosses a couple of collegiate cut-ups (Michael Hudson and Jake Picking) and Jason's cousin Nick (Adam Pally)--a disabled \"Dick\" wannabe.\r\n\r\nSo **Dirty Grandpa** marches to its wacky beat without realizing how much of a Grade-A stinker this insufferable session of comatose comedy this shoddy showcase really is at heart? Breezy bathroom-related humor, recycled masturbation giggles, bubbly bimbos and slap-happy drug use high-jinks--all befitting whatever odious overtones this needless and fetid funny fable managed to pull off.\r\n\r\nFor DeNiro and company **Dirty Grandpa** may have been a quick and profitable payday but for the rest of us the payoff was mere chump change.\r\n\r\n**Dirty Grandpa** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 42 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Robert DeNiro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza, Julianne Hough, Jason Mantzoukas, Jake Picking, Michael Hudson, Mo Collins, Dermot Mulrooney\r\n\r\nDirected by: Dan Mazer\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: * star (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng"
