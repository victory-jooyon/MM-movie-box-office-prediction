It was a big mistake. There should be no expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie all in all was okay. Just okay. It was 2 and a half hours. The clothes were awesome of course. But then sometimes I can't help but think, it's too awesome for the place you're in to be wearing it. My favorite part was the wedding. It was fun and so gay which was awesome. The plane and the hotel was amazing. There were several \"WOWs\" in the theater and I'm sure we're all thinking of the same thing: \"I wish I have a friend like Samantha\" or \"I wish I can also do that for free\". But then after a while, you can't help but  think: this is too much for this movie. It's like not sex and the city anymore. I mean they're not having sex (or they can't because they're in Abu Dabi) and they're not even in the city. The title should've been \"Sex and the City goes to Abu Dabi\" or \"Carrie and the Girls Goes to Middle East\". It doesn't make sense anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut I don't really mind watching it again. The clothes, the purses and especially the shoes are the only things that I love looking at in this movie."
