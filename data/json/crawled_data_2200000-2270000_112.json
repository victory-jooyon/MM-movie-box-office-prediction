I have seen the old version, for a 90s movie, the actions were fantastic with an awesome story. In this remake I don't know where's the story, the characters were underdeveloped and it rushed towards the end with plenty of high octane action sequences everywhere. This formula won't work all the time like '300' and 'Fury Road', but it's really good for watching in digital 3D.\r\n\r\nThe story was kind of sameness, but slightly altered, especially about that 8 ordeal and stunts were obviously freshly designed. The graphic works were weak in some parts, it failed to give a natured effect. Yeah, I think CGI is the issue, the movie relied on it for everything.\r\n\r\nThe cast performances were fine, but a big star in the lead might have given a different result. It's entertaining, but that was not enough these days, especially for a cop movie we expect details, not just physical tricks. IMO its a one time watch movie, or better try the original.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Some good films were already made out of it and this one is slightly different. It is about a man who is expecting a baby with his girlfriend who he is going marry very soon. But he gets fired from his job and clueless about raising a child and maintain the family. Then a strange phone call gives him a series of challenges to win with a greater reward. It all begins with a small easy task and then begin to complicate when he can't back off as per the rules he has agreed. Now how far he goes to finish it off what he had started was told in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nSince this is not a fresh idea for a film, I expected the story to be very good, but a little disappointed. At least it opened well and overall first half was much better. Later the film did not stand up to what it was promised in the earlier. But kind of unpredictable way it was developed. Seeing how the film was received, those who liked the original version did not like this one. That happens all the time as expected. Even though if you haven't seen the Thai film, the chances are slim one to enjoy it, especially if you have seen and liked the films like '12 Rounds', 'The Game', including the recent 'Nerve'. Not bad for watching at once, but instead I would suggest other similar title if you ask me.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"

It ends up aligning most with Julie Taymor\u2019s curious 2007 Beatles musical \u2018Across the Universe\u2019 - a really great idea and approach to the work of a musical artist that never finds its feet or the bravery to fully be itself. It\u2019s still a moving and occasionally stirring portrait of Elton John, and while the lack of emotional or narrative detail in the screenplay never allows Taron Egerton to fully unleash his potential, he\u2019s still a terrific Elton John and sings the hell out of these amazing songs. In the end, despite a refreshing honesty and some fascinating choices, \u2018Rocketman\u2019 is never as daring as it so desperately wants and needs and deserves to be, a film on the road to somewhere but never quite getting there.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-rocketman-a-fascinating-musical-biopic-that-never-finds-its-feet"

For me this is the third version from the last three consecutive years. After the original French film based on the same name of the book, followed by the Kollywood remake 'Thoongavanam'. The second film was not bad, considering the way it was made to the Indian standards. They did not change much, but in this one the initial parts were almost the same and the following developments were too much. I mean literally they turned it into twice thriller with tight action sequences. Their main idea was to leave the open conclusion for a possible sequel. Which was really too intentional that not everybody would be happy with, for like those who liked the previous versions.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, but Michelle Monaghan was the best among. Unlike the same characters from other versions, I don't know how they turned Monaghan's role so powerful. That's the negative, as the film Jamie Foxx in the lead. Otherwise, as a neutral, this is not a bad remake. The Immigrant joke was trimmed off, since today's US is not in favour of such comedies in films. And many events, especially film scenes were accelerated. So the camera moves one place to another in a quick succession unlike other versions. Yeah, these changes were needed, since the film was not a fresh piece of work or even first remake. But like I said too muchness spoiled the party. Even though one time watchable film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

            "review": "> Pretty impressive narration, a better version out there for now.\r\n\r\nUS film or UK film is not an issue, but the real question was the second movie required? Plenty of films are made in a short period of gap about the same person like 'Infamous' and 'Capote', themes like 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down', and sometimes remakes like 'Deaths at a Funeral' from other film industries. So the history says audience accepts only they are different from each other and so this film was, but very very sad it bombed at the box office.\r\n\r\nLike everybody I was not interested in this, even though it was from a renowned filmmaker. But after watching it now, I felt I was terribly wrong. Actually, this is the best version so far about the Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs. It was entirely a different narration than the previous one, everything was like the backstage drama that takes place before every product launch. That means most of the film was shot in the auditoriums and its corridor, parking lot, rooftop, and other surround places.\r\n\r\nAll the affairs like family, friends, co-founders, business, troubles et cetera are brought into one place and dealt there itself. Surely a very cleverly written screenplay and display by the actors, especially the two Oscars nominee Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslate. Once again Danny Boyle proved his directional skill with this beautiful biopic. I did not LIKE the end scene, but LOVED it. In fact, this film's end and Ashton Kutcher film's opening scenes has a clean follow. I also felt the movie was very honest, but I don't how much since I'm not into the books to learn about the famous personalities. It's not a must see, but definitely worth a try.\r\n\r\n8/10"

The film was made with a tiny budget of $50,000, wow, talk about being efficient. The story is not a convoluted one like Primer, which was based on time travel. That said, it\u2019s not very straightforward either. It does talk about some unreal patterns and could get hard to understand at times. Do give it a watch if you haven\u2019t already."

The climate is pretty much as ripe for superhero parody as it's ever going to be, _Captain Underpants_ has enjoyed moderate achievement in terms of being a household name, I even remember more or less enjoying the books as a kid. But _Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie_ is pretty bad. Not in any unexpected ways, it's reasonable to expect a certain level of humour from a film whose titular hero has \"Underpants\" in the name, but in my honest opinion, _The \"First\" Epic Movie_, should probably be the last one too.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"

It is not an event based action-comedy or something like man meets woman romance-comedy, but very random presentation. Where it begins and where it ends, you can't clearly say it is a well written script. The actings were decent, but the scenes aren't overwhelmingly impressive as it should be. Directed by 'Neon Flesh' famed filmmaker, after that film his other projects weren't up to the standards including this one.\r\n\r\nIt is written by the one who was behind the 'American Ultra'. There's a strikingly similar between these two and you won't deny if you had seen them. Especially Anna Kendrick's character to what the Jesse Eisenberg was in that film. If we go deep, Sam Rockwell as well might fall into the same category to what Kristen Stewart was. At some point, one of the film characters mentions the same secret project. So I think it is the same universe and a spin-off.\r\n\r\nSam-Kendrick combo was the highlight of the film. I hope they would do some serious subject together in the near future. The action sequences were good, other than that it's not funny at all or romantic. That means I did not enjoy it because the theme did not work for me which I felt very common these days. So it failed because of the lack of innovation and proper development, but the overall film was not bad if entertainment is the main agenda. I know there are audience for it and they will back it. I won't stand between you and your watch if you want to try it, I just say be careful, that's all.\r\n\r\n5/10"

Plenty of well developed characters throughout, and each character has great depth. The execution of the stunts was superb and had breathtaking set-pieces throughout. It's more faithful to the games than other previous game adaptions like Doom and Warcraft: The Beginning, and it moves away from the story while keeping what made the games so well received. A great movie, definitely worth the watch."

He does not enter the boxing ring any more, rather choosing a coaching job and wild high life, including continuous TV appearances, hanging out and love affairs. One morning his daughter and his wife Vika meet him at home. Vika does not see the Artyom she once fell in love with in him any longer... The externally happy life of Kolchin comes to an end when the boxer he trains is almost killed during a match with the famous Kuerte. Artyom suspects that he used some forbidden technique. To obtain the proof, he has to go to Hong Kong where his long-time friend Vagit Valiev waits for him: he knows something about Kuerte which is not known to anyone else. To win, Artyom will have to enter the ring again.",

If it just followed the compelling short description of the movie, instead of making that short description nearly EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE, it would be intriguing. This was the most tedious, redundant and gratuitous movie I've seen in a very long time. I expected the gratuitous ... it opened with an extended \"Girls Gone Wild\" sequence. But then it showed that sequence again, and again and again, then again, and again and again! This would be a \"one-star\" without James Franco. Once he is introduced you are captivated by his transformation into a wannabe gangsta rapper, especially given his tame, Disney-esque acting in \"Oz, the Great and Powerful.\" But then the tedious redundancy corrupted even his performance. The cinematography is interesting but with little plot and the unrelenting repetitiveness, even that became another irritant. If they removed all of the redundant scenes I think the movie would have been 30 minutes long."

Entering into it oblivious to any sort of bias or guideline, this Maniac proves to be a nifty shocker, one that is not without style even as it puts churnings in your stomach.\r\n\r\nIt's the stylings that I imagine have upset a lot of horror fans, the first person approach and avant-garde sheens strip the pic of genuine suspense. Yet it's a brave film in that respect, as is the casting of Elijah Wood as the titular maniac.\r\n\r\nStory is hardly original, boy had major mommy issues to deal with and has grown up disturbed. He has taken a career creating mannequins, but with real lady hair! Cue a bloody rampage of scalping - but wait! A pretty lady photographer has befriended him...\r\n\r\nSo it is what it is, a film that's grotty in narrative thrusts, yet one that's plush of cityscape photography and POV daring. An odd blend for sure, so it goes without saying, all these things need to be of interest to the viewer for it to butter your bloody sandwich. 7/10"

This film was nominated for the worst actress and supporting actress at Razzie Awards, but I found they were awesome. You can't blame performers for the bad story, in fact the screenplay was okay, but again the story did not influence to build a better screenplay. Hard to predict the scenes, though one would know where the story is heading and that's the difference in this movie. Keep in mind when you're going try it, that you're not watching a Bond movie or a Peter Jackson's, but a small budget comedy. Anticipate as much what the movie weighs, overall and you would never regret for watching it.\r\n\r\nAs usual a perfect role for Melissa McCarthy, but Susan Sarandon was surprisingly good. It was just a fun road-movie, mostly a semi-fictional to the reality, but who knows there might be people out like these film characters. Like I said, a decent story, it had all the ingredient to be a good comedy flick except one serious scene at the end needed to turn over. Yep, I would have liked to have an unexpected twist, that could have been a game changer in the movie's success. Anyone can enjoy it, if he's/she's open minded. I am already expecting the next movie from the same cast and crew combo which is due early next years.\r\n\r\nP.S, there's something between Melissa McCarthy and prison. In the next film I mentioned as well she will be seen in the prison.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Not because both the movies are about tornadoes, but takes place in a similar fashion where a group of twister/storm analyzers/chasers goes after their thing only to come out in a messed-up state. Forget the 'Twister', lets talk about this film. It had better effects, but that did not give the visuals like the natural occurrence, mostly they over-used it. I can call it a display for commercial purpose than reality, that's what Hollywood is famous for, isn't it?\r\n\r\nThe fun part was, the tornado(es) behaved like it had a soul and conscious like any living organism. 'Final Destination 5' was one of the best digital 3D movie at that time, when it comes to the awesome pop-ups and very disappointed with this film which was crafted by the same director.\r\n\r\nThe plus point was, it mildly entertains with a merely good pace of narration. Definitely it is not a category-A movie, if you want, you can say it because of the actors. The real reason is the performances from the cast was not noticeable. If one, one person had a strong hold up on his role the movie might had clinched its success. Due to CGI rule, actors are not getting a better scope for their characters. That's very sad, but true. You can watch it for entertainment or timepass, but not expecting seriously.\r\n\r\n5.5/10"

Or why I am gifting it three stars?\r\n\r\nIt was a free rental at Redox.\r\nI normally enjoy Mark Wahlberg movies.\r\nI love Bumblebee.  \r\n\r\nDo any of these hold water?\r\n\r\nI know one thing that doesn\u2019t hold a lot of water \u2013 the story. Does it really matter at this point in the franchise? There are good guy Transformers called Autobots and bad guy Transformers called Decepticons and standing between them are stupid humans that betray their species for profit \u2013 normally it\u2019s the U.S. Government. BUT wait \u2013 there is one hero that will change all of this and talk Optimus Prime (Autobot Boss Daddy) into fighting one last battle (for the fourth or fifth time \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count at this point) while some hot-looking woman runs around explosions in short-shorts.\r\n\r\nYou now know all you need to know about the entire _Transformer_ franchise.\r\n\r\nFor this incarnation we trade out Shia LeBeouf for Mark Wahlberg and Courtney Fox for Nicola Pelz. And now for the twist\u2026wait for it\u2026 Mark Wahlberg plays Nicola Pelz\u2019s FATHER.  That\u2019s right \u2013 the FATHER. Yeah, it totally doesn\u2019t work. At all.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a point in the movie about 90 minutes in where it looks like all the loose ends are going to get tied up and I thought:  You know, that wasn\u2019t so bad. Good action flick, a bit hoaky at points but watchable.\r\n\r\nAnd then the movie keeps going. And going. For another 90 minutes. And you basically watch the movie again except instead of it being in Texas and Chicago, it\u2019s in China and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too long, too many explosions, too many American flags and Texas flags in the background. This movie desperately needs an editor or it needs to be euthanized. Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman and Ken Watanabe lend their voices serve as decent comic relief but there\u2019s not a lot that can save this film.  Bumblebee deserved better."

The worst thing though is that _Clock in Its Walls_ can't keep its story straight, which is a pretty unforgivable sin when it's your own story. Like, you set the rules here, why are you going out of your way to break them for nothing?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"

            "review": "Nostalgia can be something to revisit as a decent form of escapism from one\u2019s current worries. It feels so refreshing to turn back the hands of time and recall all the wonderful memories and perks of our younger days and, what is not to consider about the days gone by when reminiscing about certain trends in music, fashion, entertainment or past relationships? For this particular theme regarding director Chris Columbus\u2019s tepid comedy \u2018Pixels\u2019, the focus pays homage to the old school pastime of video games. Sure, \u2018Pixels\u2019 tries to recapture the glory days of 80s video game mania and wrap it into an off-kilter disaster comedy that awkwardly borrows heavily from another 80s iconic big screen laugher we affectionately recognize as \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019. Instead, the clunky \u2018Pixels\u2019 is nothing more than an updated poor man\u2019s version of the aforementioned \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 with little distinctive spark or  imagination to accompany the empty zaniness. This latest lame and recycled Adam Sandler-led vehicle should come with the familiar message that is flashed at every conclusion of a video game: Game Over!\r\n\r\nEvery formulaic bone in the body of \u2018Pixels\u2019 is fragile because the movie really does not strive for anything sensational outside of its ambitious special effects wizardly. One can somewhat appreciate the few outlandish moments that garner a chuckle here and there but for the most part \u2018Pixels\u2019 suffers from transparent character developments that take a backseat to the incidental mayhem that persists.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that \u2018Pixels\u2019 is one of the few Sandler-branded films that one could actually stomach without resorting to the usual eye-rolling exasperation. Still, that is not saying very much nor is this what one might call a glowing endorsement neither. Screenwriters Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling manage to adequately stuff enough throwback reminders to the heyday of 80s-era frivolity regarding video game fever and the baby-boomers (and strangely enough youngsters and young adults) will probably relish the reminiscent goofiness of the period. The need to mesh the sentimental fixation of video games with the reliable foundation of disaster flicks that still reign supreme in today\u2019s popcorn cinema scene is challenging yet \u2018Pixels\u2019 just does not have the convincing giddy-minded gumption to pull off such a free-wheeling stunt.\r\n\r\nAs many may proudly admit their hours-long odyssey into video arcades where brain cells were bombarded by exceptional gaming skills, we come across a selection of a former (and some may even say current) \u2018nerd herd\u2019 of gifted gamers that were resourceful back in the day when their fierce video game acumen was something not to mess with at all. Leading the pack of players that were previously involved in the 1982 World Videogame Championship competition is Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), a slacker that has done nothing productive with his adult life since the notable achievement of being a runner-up at the WVC competition as a child. The champ, whose title was earned at Sam\u2019s expense, is Eddie \u2018The Fire Blaster\u2019 Plant (Peter Dinklage). Rounding out the trio is game-playing expert and conspiracy-seeking ace Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad). Oh yeah\u2026let\u2019s not forget their mutual friend Will Cooper (Sandler\u2019s comedy best buddy Kevin James) who just happens to be the President of the United States. How convenient, huh?\r\n\r\nWell, the expertise of the video-playing \u2018fearsome threesome\u2019 will come into being handy when a misinterpreted recording of a video game competition recovered in space by perturbed aliens sets off the threatening agenda for these space invaders to conquer the arrogant earthlings. After all, the taped recording ruffled the feathers of the aliens so the planet Earth needs to be challenged for the rights to claim planetary property. So the question remains: can the uninspired electronics-installing Sam, the cocky-minded Eddie and paranoid puss Ludlow defend our world and use their gaming prowess to outwit, outplay and outlast the aliens as a high stakes game is proposed for ownership of the planet?\r\n\r\nSome may dismiss \u2018Pixels\u2019 as a serviceable, quirky comedy that has a unique spirit onto its own. It does have its inserted nuttiness at various spurts. However, the overall presentation feels utterly choppy and the whole premise about these past gaming misfits returning to their childhood glory to rescue mankind through their glorified hobby comes off as manufactured, clumsy-minded campiness. There is nothing about \u2018Pixels\u2019 that screams originality besides being a faceless \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 knock-off but with familiar video game branding (the gigantic Pac Man-eating creature comes to mind as he tries to swallow the entire metropolitan region). This frenzy-minded fable seems strained for canned laughs.\r\n\r\nSandler, although not as nearly obnoxious and grating on the nerves as he is in some of his other monotonous vehicles, seems to be sleep-walking in his role as the redemptive Sam looking for that second chance to come out as victorious to undermine his otherwise mundane existence. The breath-taking Michelle Monaghan, playing Sam\u2019s shapely military protocol pop tart of a girlfriend Violet van Patten, is on hand to remind us that even labelled \u2018losers\u2019 that like to push gaming buttons on a console can get the last laugh in coming out feeling lucky. Monaghan\u2019s Violet being Sam\u2019s glamorous galpal and James\u2019s Cooper as Sam\u2019s Commander-in-Chief pal is probably the most outlandish and funny element about \u2018Pixels\u2019 to legitimately digest at this point. Gad is a mixed bag as the oafish Ludlow often opining for his indifferent pixel princess Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Dinklage steals the show as Eddie, a diminutive dynamo that is big on showy confidence within his small frame.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the insanely amusing Bill Murray and his crew of ghost-busting goof-offs need not to lose any sleep over over the perfunctory put-on that is Sandler and company in the slight and forgettable silliness of \u2018Pixels\u2019. One might want to save their roll of quarters and wash a load of dirty laundry as opposed to playing a do-or-die game of \u2018Donkey Kong\u2019 with these video game vagabonds.\r\n\r\nPixels (2015)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 45 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Adam Sandler, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Kevin James, Brian Cox, Matt Linz and Sean Bean\r\n\r\nDirected by: Chris Columbus\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy/Fantasy/Video Game Action & Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)"

Indeed, it has a nice cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.\r\n\r\nThe two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this existing one which is very familiar with this language.\r\n\r\nPeople would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this one.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

This genre has been having trouble for the past few years (only a handful of films are worthy of high praise), but Long Shot's amazing cast called my attention at the beginning of 2019 when I was organizing my watchlist of the year. I genuinely love Rogen type of humor, and Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses of the 21st century. Add three more terrific actors like Bob Odenkirk (President Chambers), O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Lance), and an unrecognizable Andy Serkis (Parker Wembley), and you have yourself a clear path to success.\r\n\r\nSo, what's the missing key ingredient? A well-written and compelling story, which is the number one problem with rom-coms of today. Most of these movies go straight to streaming services since they're the easiest ones to produce. Just gather a reasonably decent cast, put together a cliche narrative about how two people with nothing in common end up together through the most unlikely and dumb plot devices, and you have a low-budget \u201csuccess\u201d. Long Shot\u2018s premise follows a variation of that concept and it still carries the trademark conventionality, but it's the chemistry of its leads, the hilarious comedy and the beautifully-written screenplay that makes this one stand out.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues don't feel forced, a large portion of the jokes land, and the best compliment I can give to this film: it took itself seriously, and it worked seamlessly. There\u2019s a heartfelt message to transmit to the viewers, and it\u2019s delivered in the most realistic possible way. The romance doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched or born out of nowhere. Instead, it has a wonderful arc, filled with real-life relationship moral dilemmas and difficult decisions. Everything that any character says either makes sense or makes you laugh.\r\n\r\nThe cast is brilliant as expected. Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron\u2018s chemistry is palpable, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why the romance part of the movie works. They clearly had much fun on-set, and that\u2019s visible on the big screen. Rogen provides most of the laughs, but he also proves that he can be dramatic if necessary.  Theron is just impeccable. She simply can\u2019t act a single line of her script in a way that\u2019s not perfect, whether it\u2019s a romantic scene or a comedy bit. Her range is on display throughout the entire runtime, and Jonathan Levine should be extremely grateful as a director to have such an outstanding actress to work with.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all of this, there\u2019s one thing I never expected to be praising right now: the makeup department. Before the film, I knew that Andy Serkis was on the cast, but I completely forgot what his role was. Without an ounce of exaggeration, I truly believe that it\u2019s almost impossible to recognize him as Wembley if you don\u2019t know beforehand that he participates in the movie. When I re-checked the cast members, I remembered that he had a role indeed, and I was almost as surprised by the discovery as I was with how much I enjoyed this film. O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. also delivers a hilarious performance while Bob Odenkirk doesn\u2019t really have much screentime to shine.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that you can\u2019t precisely point out obvious flaws. A flawless film doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a perfect 10/10 movie. It just means you really don\u2019t have any major issues with it. If every single aspect of a film is just \u201cgood\u201d, then the movie is \u201cgood\u201d, not \u201cincredible\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d. That is how I view Long Shot. It\u2019s an extremely entertaining rom-com, undeniably one of the best I\u2019ve seen these past few years. Even though the main concept follows the genre\u2019s traditional storylines, its well-written screenplay, hilarious comedy bits, and outstanding protagonists make a surprisingly serious story remarkably entertaining. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fast-paced 2-hour runtime that I recommend to anyone who just wants to have a good time at the movie theater.\r\n\r\nRating: B+"

Plenty of large and small scale flicks came out and among them I was eagerly waiting for this one. If the story is what you always prefer with a fine production quality, then this film won't disappoint you. The performances were also well supported. Then what was this film's issue?\r\n\r\nThe last time widely accepted movie by Tarsem Singh was when he engaged in the screenplay development. After that he did not see much success where all his directed ones were written by others. My perception is that he must do those both department where he's good at it. Take this film as an example, an awesome story and had a good cast, but the writing was let down according to many who saw it.\r\n\r\nEven in the short period of appearance, Ben Kingsley's role's legacy carried out till the end, because the concept was designed like that way. Being one of the top actors, Ryan Reylands films are not that celebratable. Though he's doing a decent flicks often and those were failing to recognise in the higher level, which did not spare this one as well.\r\n\r\nPeople are comparing it to 'Face/off', but to me it looked more like coming together of 'The Island' and 'Skeleton Key'. Whatever it is I had a good time. Not a fresh concept of an idea, but narrated differently and it needed a bit depth in showcasing everything in the film.\r\n\r\nMy formula/secret for watching a movie successfully even it considered as an average or worse is, I won't bother for all the departments come together to become a well crafted product like the critics expect, because I'm a movie fanatic and love watching them almost most of the time than arguing about its flawed contents. If I find anything solely interesting like acting, music, story, visuals, I respect the efforts. So do I to this one and believe me it is much better than what the critics say so.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "What should have made 'Mallu Singh' interesting is a firm, appealing story, because this is the film that has the perfect backdrop already. Set in the rural locales of Punjab where there is a whole lot of mirth going on under the blazing sun; where nature stands one with man, 'Mallu Singh' lacks this one thing that it needed most!\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is a tale to tell, but it goes thus. Ani (Kunchacko Boban) goes to Punjab in search of a long lost brother Hari (Unni Mukundan) only to discover that the man has transformed into Hareender Singh. Confused beyond his wits, Ani determines to find out if Hareender is indeed Hari in disguise\r\nMallu Singh, as one of the characters in the film rightly points out is Hitler Madhavankutty reincarnate, and would make mincemeat of anyone who dares look at his four sisters (played by Aparna Nair, Meera Nandan, Rupa Manjari and Shawlin).\r\n\r\nThere is a moral lesson that the film upholds; that having a hoard of enterprising young actors aboard will not save a film. The narrative is bound to be equally if not more important, and when a film falls shorts on that very vital feature, the results are bound to be dismal.\r\n\r\nUsually the USP of all of Vyshakh's films is that they keep you entertained with harmless gags, even as the plot is not one to be boasted of. Unfortunately 'Mallu Singh' is infinitely low in the jokes department as well, and there are very few instances in it that would genuinely bring out a smile.\r\n\r\nThe story build up in a predictable manner leads to a conventional climax with no surprises in store. Eventually it all comes down to a stage when you realize that 'Mallu Singh' makes no special efforts to put across to the audience an inventive tale.\r\n\r\nUnni Mukundan, who has earlier been seen in promising roles, does get launched as a real hero in 'Mallu Singh' but the kicks that he gets to deliver are a bit too inflated. He's definitely good, but the action sequences of the film stand out as the worst part and with each sturdy blow that Mallu Singh delivers the overall impact of the film is further weakened.\r\n\r\nShaji's frames are the best thing about the film, and perhaps it would be right to say that it's an achievement that he has succeeded to make you keep your gaze fixed on the screen despite the very mundane affairs that occur there. M Jayachandran's musical score is definitively impressive as well.\r\n\r\n'Mallu Singh' disappoints you on multiple levels; regarding the story, the script and above everything else in its failure to proffer its talented lead actor a challenging role that could have made a whole lot of a difference"

Anyway, it's Jason Bateman's movie, which is also his first directional venture. A refreshing theme because only a very few movies were made based on the spelling bee contest, but this one was a bit messed up story narration. Most of the narrative looked so pale and dull. It is supposed to be an exciting storytelling with blistering pace.\r\n\r\nYou know, stories in the movies happen with a backdrop of the reasons. Like a piece of uninteresting wood carved into a something that attracts everybody. Some movie holds it till the end to reveal that beauty in the form of a twist, but some won't mind explaining it along the way. In this movie, what they had for the twist was lifeless, boring one, more like a clich\u00e9 from the older days flick.\r\n\r\nThe boy from the movie 'Jack and Jill' was decent. I felt some material in the movie was inappropriate regarding a minor in one of the lead roles. But I know the title clearly suggests it is only for adults. Understandable that the writer wanted to give something new, but he could not get it right. Maybe lacked to bring some interesting and inspiring elements. What surprised me was, it was not either for commercial benefit nor a fine art piece.\r\n\r\nAll the way I knew something was not clinching and finally found out the approach to portray the main character in the negative mode had to do with something. They wanted the viewers to go against him and well, they got it in a way. Interestingly the screenplay was from the 'Black List' which was untouched for almost 10 years. Unfortunately Bateman decided to give it a try and the result is,... Here I'm with not satisfied fully, but okay-okay movie for being at least something different.\r\n\r\n6/10"

When I saw the movie poster with that building the background, I thought the movie would be something like 'White House Down' which will be defended against the terrorist takeover/attack. Poster also misleads that the movie is a complete action pack, but it was not. It was a crime-thriller which was based on the real story.\r\n\r\nThe sudden variation in scenes and the character behaviors kind of  incompetence to keep balanced everything in the story progress. Inspired by a real event is what kept my interest all the way. Suppose it was fictional that was written for the movie I would have said the writer was confused between character to build and story development.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the performances promised to conclude the movie on a high note and it does. One of it was Dwayne Johnson, actually it was not his movie, but his part was a highlight alongside Liam Hemsworth and Michael Angarano. Could have done a little better in few parts for the best outcome. Anyway, it will entertain you, but cannot remain in your memory for so long.\r\n\r\n6/10"

However it had indeed satisfied the expectations, and further more had hit the right chord to their target audience. On the other hand, the movie was compared with many other movies which had similar kind of themes (college campus), but SOTY is an altogether a complete film with different storyline, and thus provides you a totally fresh and entertaining product.\r\n\r\n**Story**\r\n\r\nIt is the story about three friends - Abhimanyu Singh, Rohan Nanda and Shanaya Singhania - and their group of buddies. Rohan Nanda aka Ro (Varun Dhawan) is a rich son of a well-known business tycoon Nanda (Ram Kapoor), and rules the St. Teresa's High School (Dehradun) with his style, attitude and riches. He is quite flirty among other girls, but has a beautiful and gorgeous girlfriend, Shanaya (Alia Bhatt). Also though Ro was a rich son of an entrepreneur, but he had a soft heart for everyone. Shanaya is a rich modern girl, who thinks herself as a fashion designer, and rules the college with her charm, beauty, and sex-appeal. Now the entry of Abhimanyu aka Abhi, he hails from a small town and aspires to become a big person one fine day. Abhi rules the college with his style, attitude and a perfect victory in everything. This irks Ro, and the two often clashes with each other. However because of his soft heart, both of them became friends and then best friends.\r\n\r\nThe turning point comes when an unexpected love triangle happens between Ro, Abhi and Shanaya, which is further followed by the 'Student Of The Year' competition in St. Teresa's High School. How these three people copes up with their complicated relationship, and eventually who wins the coveted trophy of Student Of The Year, forms the crux of the story.\r\n\r\n**Final Verdict**\r\n\r\nIt's a new age mixture of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, with a complete different and engaging storyline. On the whole, Karan Johar's 'Student Of The Year' is a perfect film for all the youngistan, a perfect film for entertainment, and a perfect film to watch it again and again. 'Student Of The Year' is the 'Film Of The Year' for the youth gang."

I did not know what this film was about. I did not know who stars in it and when it released. But I decided to watch it at the last minute without checking out its synopsis and I ended up satisfied. Not fully pleased, but the refreshing story and its characters interested me.\r\n\r\nThis is an unusual drama that takes place in a district where the Hollywood people are dominated. Our tale opens with a young woman arriving there and soon gets an opportunity to become a famous artist's personal assistant. The film also focuses others tales, so it is a multi layered story. But all of them are somewhere connected; particularly at the end. Revealing everyone's agenda behind their act is what brings the conclusion to the tale.\r\n\r\nNot neatly told story, yet different. I would say futuristic theme. I liked the performances. Robert Pattinson was not in a major role, but the other like Mia Wasikowska, Julianne Moore were good. Revolving around the bunch film celebrities means there's no real ones involved with the real names, just mentioned the names who were not in the film. Hard to predict the story, I was not sure until it revealed itself everything at the end. That part was a quite a shock, not I expected, but that's the real twist. Overall film was decent, slightly it missed to be a great. I feel it is worth a watch if you want something new in the story.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"

I'd also say the musical pieces are enjoyable across the opening 20-30 minutes, which are nice and energetic.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the midway point things start chugging down to a snail's pace. The novelty of the premise begins to wear thin, as it becomes clear that there isn't much more to tell - despite a load of the 125 minute run time still remaining. I will say, though, the look of the film is pleasant.\r\n\r\nI do also rate the casting. James Corden seems to split opinion online, but I've always liked him; having watched and enjoyed him since his career took off with UK TV's <em>'Gavin & Stacey'</em>. Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp are two of my favourite actors, while Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick are strong casts. I like Chris Pine too, but he's iffy in this.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I almost found entertainment with this but overall it disappoints due to its poor pacing and gappy plot."

That in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing to have happen, but this one is.  Found footage should be found, this is more like first person account...or a fake-umentary.\r\n\r\nEcho itself (it is not a \"he\") is cute enough but spends a lot of time hiding and there is a communication barrier, but only one way.  If it can connect to the smartphone, then it should be able to use the device as a speaker to express the language it understands from the kids.\r\n\r\nAlot of the movie is just young boys being defiant and \"girls have cooties, but I like it\".  It fails as a \"coming of age\", it fails as a \"romance\", and it barely succeeds as sci-fi or \"evil secret organization\".\r\n\r\nThis had the potential to be the next \"E.T.\", but they just made weird choices throughout the design."

            "review": "Unlike others, I would say it was a nice movie from Ridley Scott. Certainly not a masterpiece, but I truly enjoyed it. For his capability this movie was a below par, that's what everyone meant. As for the theme of the story, it was a phenomenal, but the screenplay is what failed very badly. To me, some of the scenes in the movie were impressive, enough to stick around the end. As has been a gangster related subject, Midas touch lacks and surprises how a great director make it slip away.\r\n\r\nHandling a tough situation, following the instinct and the facing outcome of the final result is what the movie to say in a one liner. Obviously, roles were perfectly distributed to the respective cast by the filmmakers and they had given their best as well. So no blame game for the movie's fall in that matter. In my perception it was the dull moments in the movie that acquire more than the best parts. When it was overhauled to build the story and develop characters, never showed signs of recovery.\r\n\r\nAs I am a movie maniac, after seeing a movie, I always think of a sequel to follow only if it was a good one, or I pray for no sequel if it was terrible. I thought the same about this movie as well, after seeing the way it ended. I am now curious what if a sequel makes the way and impacts better than this. Because in the history, so many sequels had excelled than the previous movies. Whatever, I respect this film, not because of the director or actors, but like everyone says it should have been little better in a few areas, that's all. A movie fanatic sees the effort and appreciate it even it was not that good, but a critic sees only flaws and criticise as usual.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.\r\n\r\nI went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.\r\n\r\n7/10"
