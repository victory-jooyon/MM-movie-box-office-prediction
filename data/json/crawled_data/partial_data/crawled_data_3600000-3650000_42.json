            "review": "**_Laconic, measured and easy to digest, although it could have done with more substance_**\r\n\r\n> _How many addicts are out on the street simply because Mr. Sharp brought the cocaine here?_\r\n\r\n- Sam Dolnick quoting AUSA Chris Graveline; \"The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule\"; _New York Times_ (June 11, 2014)\r\n\r\n63 years since he first appeared on-screen (an uncredited role in Jack Arnold's 1955 _Revenge of the Creature_), _The Mule_ is 88-year-old Clint Eastwood's first acting role since Robert Lorenz's _Trouble with the Curve_ in 2012, and his first film as a director since about a week ago. It is, however, the first time he's directed himself since the excellent _Gran Torino_ in 2008. Known for being incredibly efficient when it comes to filmmaking, Eastwood likes to get scripts into production before they've gone through too many rewrites, he rigidly shoots only what's on the page, he avoids multiple takes and on-set experimentation, and he keeps the editing process as simple as possible \u2013 so basically, he's the anti-Terrence Malick. With this in mind, he has maintained an extraordinary rate of turnover, with _The Mule_ the 37th feature he's directed since _Play Misty for Me_ in 1971.\r\n\r\nOf course, when you work at that rate for as long as he has, you're going to put out a few duds, and although his directorial output has gone through ups and downs in the past, his most recent work has been arguably the most disappointing of his career, with pretty much everything he's directed since _Gran Torino_ being subpar. Whether it's the hokey sentimentality of _Hereafter_ (2010), the oversimplification (and awful makeup) of _J. Edgar_ (2011), the lifeless _Jersey Boys_ (2014), the unashamed and troubling jingoism of _American Sniper_ (2015), the unnecessary embellishments of _Sully_ (2016), or the spectacularly misjudged experiment in casting that was _15:17 to Paris_ (2018), the days when he could direct no less than seven masterpieces \u2013 _Unforgiven_ (1992), _A Perfect World_ (1993), _The Bridges of Madison County_ (1995), _Mystic River_ (2003), _Million Dollar Baby_ (2004), _Flags of Our Fathers_ (2006), and _Letters from Iwo Jima_ (2006) \u2013 in a 14-year period are long gone. Indeed, the most notable thing he's done in the last decade is ramble somewhat incoherently to an empty chair.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that _The Mule_ is a strangely formless film, almost a collection of only vaguely connected scenes rather than an actual narrative with forward momentum; it has precious little depth or nuance; there's some troubling casual racism, most of which we're encouraged to laugh at; the tone is all over the place; Eastwood's character has not one, but _two_ threesomes with young women; and it wastes almost all of its excellent cast. The good news is that, somehow, it's extremely enjoyable, and is easily the best film he's directed since _Gran Torino_.\r\n\r\nTelling the story of Earl Stone (Eastwood), a 90-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran, the film begins in 2005 as Stone is honoured at a daylily festival. Clearly enjoying the adulation (and the attention from the ladies), he doesn't seem to care that he's supposed to be attending the wedding of his daughter Iris (Eastwood's real daughter, Alison Eastwood). As she frets about his failure to turn up, Mary (Dianne Wiest), Stone's ex-wife and Iris's mother, points out that it's not a shock, as he has a history of letting his family down. The film then jumps to 2017 \u2013 Iris hasn't spoken to him since her wedding, and he is estranged from the whole family, except Iris's daughter, Ginny (Taissa Farmiga), who is herself getting married. His daylily business has gone bust, unable to compete with online shopping, and his house is in foreclosure. After a very public dressing down from Mary, Stone is approached by a friend of Ginny's who tells him that he knows some people who will pay anyone with a perfect driving record to \"_just drive_\" for them. Arriving at a garage guarded by heavily armed Hispanics, Stone is told to drive some duffle bags from El Paso to Chicago, with the only rule that he isn't to look inside the bags. He happily agrees, apparently unaware he has just signed on to mule for the Sinaloa Cartel. When he does inevitably look in the bags, finding cocaine, he isn't especially bothered, and as his first few runs go well, the Cartel start to increase the amount of drugs he's muling. So much so that cartel boss, Laton (Andy Garc\u00eda), asks to personally meet this new mule, who has been nicknamed \"Tata\" (\"Grandfather\") by his handlers. Meanwhile, the leader of a DEA task force (Laurence Fishburne) is under pressure to start getting results, and so he gives agents Bates (Bradley Cooper) and Trevino (Michael Pe\u00f1a) instructions to start making arrests sooner rather than later, which they promise to do, explaining that they are nearing in on a prime target \u2013 a prolific mule known only as Tata.\r\n\r\nWritten by Nick Schenk, who also wrote _Gran Torino_, _The Mule_ is, extraordinarily, based on a true story. Specifically, it's inspired by Sam Dolnick's 2014 _New York Times_ article, \"The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule\", which tells the story of Leo Sharp, an award-winning horticulturist and World War II veteran who became the Sinaloa Cartel's most reliable mule. Despondent from financial problems and the loss of his daylily business, Sharp began transporting cocaine from Arizona to Michigan in 2005. With Sinaloa quickly realising how reliable he was, he was soon moving up to 300 kilograms per trip and transporting as much as $2million dollars in the opposite direction. In October 2011, while in possession of 90 kilograms, Sharp was arrested by Michigan state police operating as part of a DEA task force. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released in 2015 after a year behind bars, due to declining health. He died of natural causes in 2016 at the age of 92.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be said about _The Mule_ is that the trailer is misleading. And then some. Suggesting a tense, nail-biting thriller in which Stone is appalled to find out what he has been transporting, but is unable to back out of his deal, and must try to keep the Cartel on-side whilst evading the attention of the DEA, the trailer has next-to-no relationship with the actual film. It's not tense, my nails were thoroughly unbitten, Stone isn't overly concerned when he learns what's in the bags, and the very narrative structure means it's inevitable that Bates will catch up to him sooner or later. It most certainly isn't the Michael Mann-esque crime thriller it's being advertised as. Instead, _The Mule_ is laconic and contemplative, laid-back and not especially dramatic (there's more fireworks in the arguments Stone has with his family than in his relationship with the Cartel, and the film as a whole is more _Last of the Summer Wine_ than _Miami Vice_). Indeed, as drama, _The Mule_ is fairly insubstantial, telling a threadbare story populated by underwritten characters, void of much of an emotional core, and with next-to-nothing in the way of an exciting _d\u00e9nouement_.\r\n\r\nAs a director, Eastwood's last three films (_American Sniper_, _Sully_, and _The 15:17 to Paris_) have all told true stories of ordinary people who have come to be seen as heroes for one reason or another, whether they wanted to or not. Earl Stone is definitely not a hero (any more than Leo Sharp), but he is an everyman, a person down on his luck who finds a way to stick it to the system. And that makes him, at best, empathetic, and at worst, an anti-hero (yes, the fact that he's literally transporting misery and suffering is problematic, but we'll get to that). Stone is charming, funny, and intelligent, and his attempts to make up for his mistakes with Iris by being there for Ginny seem genuine. Eastwood plays Stone as full of regret, someone who knows he was a terrible husband and father, and the fact that his estranged daughter is played by his real daughter gives the film the impression of being personal (Eastwood, like Stone, has an, let's be diplomatic, \"appreciation\" for the ladies). From a physical standpoint, Eastwood looks noticeably older than he did in _Trouble with the Curve_; he walks hunched over, he looks frail enough for a strong wind to knock him down, there's next-to-no meat on his arms. Almost all of that Eastwood-ruggedness is gone, and this is easily the most physically vulnerable we've ever seen him on screen, even more so than that other titan of old-school American masculinity, John Wayne, who made _The Shootist_ (1976) when he was literally dying.\r\n\r\nIn a lot of ways, Stone is not unlike Walt Kowalski, the hateful racist character Eastwood played in _Gran Torino_. They are both Korean War veterans who find themselves alienated from the world they live in, and who believe the next generation lack fortitude (at one point, Stone complains, \"_this generation can't open a fruit-box without calling the internet_\"). However, Stone is much softer, and on the universal scale of racism, whereas Kowalski is Mel Gibson-racist, Stone is Prince Philip-racist; the type of racism we forgive because he's 837 years old, half-senile, and grew up \"_in a different time_.\" Sure, he calls Hispanics \"beaners\" and jokes about them getting deported, but they don't seem to mind. Sure, he pulls over to help a black couple change a tire, proudly telling them he likes \"_to help the negro folks out_\", but they just politely inform him that people don't use the word \"negro\" anymore. And it isn't just ethnicities. Encountering a group of lesbian bikers, he refers to them as \"_dykes on bikes_\". All three of these examples are played for laughs, and whilst that might be fair enough in a film that depicts non-Caucasians with something resembling diversity, _The Mule_'s non-white characters are one-dimensional stereotypes; every Hispanic character, for example, is either a drug-running criminal (most of whom have neck tattoos) or an industrious labourer. If the film itself didn't come across as so racially reductive, Stone's racism would be easier to accept and defend.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the film's most egregious failing, however, is that it never once addresses the fact that Stone's criminal enterprise is fuelling addiction and destroying lives; as far as the film is concerned, he may as well be transporting oranges. The darker implications of his drug-running are kept firmly behind the curtain, out of sight of the audience. Instead, _The Mule_ presents Stone as almost a modern-day Robin Hood, using his new-found cash to pay for Ginny's wedding and education, and to renovate the local VA hall. This _could_ be a sly comment on Obama-era economics, suggesting that the country is in such a mess that issues like the exorbitant price of education and the mistreatment of veterans can only be addressed with the proceeds of crime. But honestly, that's a serious stretch, and it seems far more likely it's the film's way of ensuring we continue to admire Stone despite what he's doing. In any case, even when the film has no option but to directly deal with his criminality, it's done in such a way as to minimise the darker aspects. For example, Laton may be the most jovial and least-threatening drug lord ever put on screen. Garc\u00eda does what he can with the part, but given the fact that most of his screen time sees him fooling about with a solid gold shotgun, his options are limited (one legitimately funny moment sees Stone marvelling at Laton's mansion, asking \"_who do I have to kill to get a place like this?_\" to which Laton responds, \"_many, many people_\"). A much more effective character is Gustavo (Clifton Collins Jr.), Laton's henchman. Collins Jr. is a superb actor, and can do legitimately intimidating in his sleep, but even an actor of his calibre can do little with only three scenes, in two of which he doesn't even have any dialogue (in a film with a wasted cast, the underuse of Collins Jr. stands out).\r\n\r\nHand-in-hand with the film's non-threatening drug runners is its depiction of local law enforcement, who are, for the most part, presented sarcastically (at one point, Stone distracts a pesky cop with a tub of caramel popcorn). The DEA characters are presented a little more respectfully, however. Fishburne's unnamed character, for example, is depicted as a good agent shackled by a bureaucracy that only cares for short-term wins. Thus, they pressure him to pressure his field agents to get results before the case has matured, meaning any arrests will be strictly low-level. This aspect of the film reminded me of the first season of _The Wire_, where Deputy Ops. Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) is constantly pressuring Lt. Daniels (Lance Reddick) to get some \"_dope on the table_\" \u2013 small scale arrests that provide a photo op for Baltimore PD brass to proudly display the confiscated dope on the table, irrespective of the fact that such operations result in the arrests of street hoppers rather than anyone in management.\r\n\r\nA key scene in relation to the film's depiction of both law-enforcement and minorities, but one which is disappointingly played for laughs, is when the cops pull over who they think is Tata only to quickly realise it's the wrong man (it's a young Hispanic) and they're guilty of racial profiling. The man is terrified, well aware of stats concerning police shootings of non-whites (there's something deeply unsettling about how well he knows the routine, and his line, \"_statistically speaking, this is the most dangerous five minutes of my life_\" speaks volumes about modern America). The scene should have given rise to a socio-political commentary \u2013 what is it like to be the victim of racial profiling, how does it feel to know that you've just committed racial profiling, what does it say about society in general when an innocent man knows enough about such instances as to fear for his life? Eastwood, however, is more interested in guffaws. We've seen racial profiling and resultant deaths examined in several recent films \u2013 Steve McQueen's _Widows_, George Tillman, Jr.'s _The Hate U Give_, and Reinaldo Marcus Green's _Monsters and Men_ (all 2018) \u2013 as well as slightly older titles such as Paul Haggis's _Crash_ (2004) and Ryan Coogler's _Fruitvale Station_ (2013), but the depiction here is, sadly, very shallow. The film is also silent on the inverse \u2013 that Stone is such a good mule because of his white privilege.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the film's structure is bizarre \u2013 there's no real sense of narrative cohesion, as one scene jumps to another without a huge amount connecting them. You could take the various driving scenes, cut them in a completely different manner, and you would still have the same film; Stone picks up the drugs, drives for a while, drops off the drugs and gets paid, drives some more, has a scene with his family, we check in on the DEA, Stone picks up the drugs, drives for a while etc. The whole thing feels void of urgency, and after a while you realise that the threadbare outline of a story is all the story you're going to get. Additionally, there's an utter lack of tension (for which Eastwood tries to compensate with silly scenes such as when Bates follows Stone into a parking lot and shouts \"Hey.\" Is he going to arrest our hero? Nah, Stone just left his flask behind). On top of this, the way Eastwood's camera leers at the bare asses of a bunch of women at a party in Laton's house is disconcerting, and pretty much a textbook example of the male gaze. Also, with the single exception of Stone, the characters are one-dimensional at best (Fishburne's character doesn't even get a name; Pe\u00f1a is nothing but the comic relief to Cooper's straight man).\r\n\r\nIf all that sounds negative, it should, because I focused on what I felt was wrong with the film. However, irrespective of these failings, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Mule_. It could and should have been a lot better. It could have been a socially conscious thriller looking at racial profiling, drug-dealing, American masculinity, generational conflict, socio-economic issues. But, in fairness, that isn't the film Eastwood set out to make. He has made many interesting political films in his career. _The Mule_ is not one of them. Instead, he's turned the material into a jaunty, congenial, inoffensive, and easy-to-watch meditation on age and family, set in a _milieu_ where the one-time trappings of male success are now considered character failings, and focused on a character unable to wrap his brain around this shift in ideology. Despite myself, I can forgive the casual racism, the structural problems, the wasted cast, the use of serious social issues to get cheap laughs, and I can do so because the film is simply enjoyable. _The Mule_ isn't going to change your life, nor is it going to win Eastwood a legion of new fans. But it was never supposed to. Instead, it accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. And it's immensely entertaining to boot."

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThis is the third canon (or official if you\u2019re not familiar with anime terms) Dragon Ball movie, after Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \u2018F\u2019. So, unless you kept up with the anime, this film isn\u2019t for you. Just letting you know right off the bat.\r\n\r\nI would love to be able to describe in words what Dragon Ball means to me, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible to create a sentence that seamlessly lets you know how nervously excited I was right before the movie started. Yesterday, it was my first time watching my favorite anime on the big screen, and oh my God, it was AWESOME! Finally, I watched a film that I was highly anticipating, and I actually enjoyed it. Finally! I was tired of expecting big things from movies I really wanted to become a huge success, just to get ultimately disappointed. Broly is everything I wished for and more. Nevertheless, I must advise you: this animated flick is NOT for a casual moviegoer! \r\n\r\nIf you stopped following Dragon Ball after Z or you don\u2019t even know what DB is, you\u2019ll basically be lost. You won\u2019t recognize certain characters, you won\u2019t understand how and why some guys are still alive, and you\u2019ll have no clue about how strong our warriors became. This is for the fans. I\u2019ve seen critics bashing this film to shreds, and they start their reviews stating \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the anime.\u201d Then why would you watch a movie that clearly follows the anime\u2019s story and review it? Just leave it alone! It\u2019s like watching Avengers: Endgame without ever watching a single one of the 21 previous installments. It\u2019s just nonsensical. So, with that out of the way, and assuming I\u2019m writing for fans of the anime \u2026 \r\n\r\nThis is the best Dragon Ball film ever, by a long shot. Yes, the track record wasn\u2019t that good to begin with, and most of the movies released aren\u2019t even canon. Still, Battle of Gods and Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 were pretty great, especially the former. Broly easily surpasses these two, in almost every aspect. Of course, I need to be fair to those first films. Dragon Ball Super elevated the anime once again and brought it back to the mainstream, so obviously, Broly had a lot of advantages since the studios offered everything they could so that the movie would be a major success. When the first two films were released, Super didn\u2019t exist yet. Basically, these first movies were trying to bring back Dragon Ball to life while Broly is all about keeping it alive and showing it still has tremendous potential.\r\n\r\nThankfully, it all worked out perfect. The box office results are mind-blowing which will surely guarantee the continuation of Super (I\u2019m waiting every single day for the news of the series renewal), and the film is, in fact, astonishing. The animation quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. You know when you go with friends to watch a movie and something so awesome occurs that you just look at each other in awe of what just happened? That\u2019s Broly every single minute from the moment the fight begins. Super gave the fans a glimpse of what the animation level could be if time was not an issue for the animators. The Tournament of Power arc is undeniable proof that when the production leaves the animators work with no pressure, the end result is outstanding.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just so freaking awesome. This is the only word in the dictionary that can reflect how crazily good the animation is. Awesome. There are so many long sequences of choreographed fights, with the animation always on-point, and with exceptional editing. The aspect I love the most is probably how fast it all is. Finally, I can understand Krillin when he says \u201chow are you following that?!\u201d Everything flows in such a flawless style: the characters, the blasts, the environment, everything. The sound design is incredibly powerful, as well. From the get-go, you know you\u2019ll feel every punch, kick, \u201cKamehameha\u201d and \u201cGalick Gun.\u201d Goku, Vegeta, and Broly provide so many amazing action scenes, and I know I\u2019ll constantly rewatch them once they become available. God, Super ended a year ago, and I still find myself watching the final fight with Jiren every week or so.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dragon Ball isn\u2019t about the fights. Yes, everyone loves them, and there are a lot of fans who only care about the actual moment when our heroes fight their enemies. As a hardcore fan of the saga, it\u2019s so much more than that. If characters like Goku and Vegeta, but also Piccolo, Gohan or even Frieza didn\u2019t exist, their battles wouldn\u2019t have the same impact. They mean something because these characters are important to me. I care so much about them because they were beautifully-developed throughout hundreds of episodes. I know that fillers can be a bit boring, but for me, they were just another way of getting to know these characters. Give me twenty minutes of banter between Goku and Vegeta, and I\u2019ll be the happiest man on Earth, right now.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll put it this way: if you enjoyed Battle of Gods more than Resurrection \u2019F\u2019, you will love DBS: Broly as much or more than I do. If it\u2019s the other way around, the first half of this film might leave you a bit disappointed. If you\u2019re one of those fans who only care about the fights, you can leave the first 45 minutes with barely any Goku or Vegeta to me and the other fans who care about the story. I heavily praise Akira Toriyama\u2018s screenplay. This is the big difference to the other non-canon movies: they weren\u2019t written by someone who really understands the characters at their disposal. Toriyama knows exactly who Broly is, where he comes from, and how he lived through his young years.\r\n\r\nHe wonderfully flushes out Broly by giving him an emotionally captivating backstory, filled with parent abuse, violence, and isolation from the rest of the universe. The history of Saiyans and Planet Vegeta is (finally) told entirely, by showing us characters that we all know and love, but that we were never able to see for more than a few minutes. Nevertheless, the standout character of the film is Broly. He has more screentime than any of the other warriors, precisely due to the reason I mentioned above: for us to care about him. Truth is, when they start fighting, I don\u2019t want anyone to win or lose, because I genuinely care about all of them. Toriyama wasted half of the movie to develop this \u201cnew\u201d character, and I 100% support his decision. Not only it generates more build-up to the inevitable climax, but it offers more layers to it. It stopped being \u201cjust a fight.\u201d\r\n\r\nObviously, there were going to be nods to the past adventures. I almost dropped a tear when Goku and Vegeta show up for the first time due to the soundtrack alone. You\u2019ll love every single \u201cflash\u201d regarding previous moments of Dragon Ball history, including the latest series and arc. Toriyama also does a remarkable job in helping fans that never watched Super trying to understand what happened after Z, even if he didn\u2019t need to. The comedy bits are hilarious, as they have been with the latest series. From Vegeta yelling at Goku for doing or saying something dumb, to Bulma\u2018s interactions with Beerus and Whis, every joke lands in one way or another.\r\n\r\nAs much as I love this film, it does have some issues regarding its mixing of CGI with animation. One of the things I didn\u2019t like at all in Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 was how some sequences felt like a video game. Unfortunately, there are a couple of moments like that in Broly. In order to keep the scenes flow without any cuts, CGI is necessary so the camera can change to another angle, and sometimes there\u2019s this feeling that you seem to be playing one of Dragon Ball games. However, my biggest gripe has to be with the overuse of visual effects. Using VFX to build rich environment and help the battles have more impact, not only doesn\u2019t work well but it\u2019s just not Dragon Ball.\r\n\r\nAs we reach the climax, the VFX overpower the animation, and that is never a good thing. The fight loses its animated essence, and it becomes something that I don\u2019t even know how to describe, except that it isn\u2019t what it was supposed to be. In addition to this, even though I stated that this movie is about Broly and Broly alone, I would have loved to see more from Frieza. He acts purely as a plot device, and there\u2019s barely anything for him to actively do, but he\u2019s still important to make the plot move forward. Finally, the pacing could have been more balanced. Since the ending is predictable from even before the fight begins, it feels that the film was a bit stretched to try to reach the two-hour runtime.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you\u2019ve seen all the trailers, you basically know the entire movie. That\u2019s why I keep advising my followers to stop watching trailers or at least all of them. If you really need visual confirmation that the film deserves your time and money, watch the first trailer and decide from there. Dragon Ball Super always gave spoiler-heavy previews of the next episode, and the movie literally shows everything. Even without watching a single clip from it, I couldn\u2019t escape the spoilers regarding the appearance of specific characters, which pretty much ruined any surprise the film could have offered me. Even with that in mind, I still think the ending felt a bit rushed, contradicting the somewhat slow pace during the first two acts.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there\u2019s no doubt about it. Dragon Ball Super: Broly is, by far, the best Dragon Ball movie to date, and it\u2019s really freaking awesome! It beats any other installment of the franchise, including the latest films. Akira Toriyama working together with a phenomenal team of animators is a match made in heaven. The story is remarkably well-written, with a full half dedicated to introduce and develop Broly as a mentally troubled child who had to deal with so much pain during his life. The animation reaches its peak quality-wise, demonstrating that when time is given to the animators, their work can be a visual masterpiece. With such an intriguing backstory on the history of Saiyans and a brilliantly structured build-up to an epic fight between Broly, Goku, and Vegeta, there was still time to cherish the nostalgia with some nods to previous moments in the beloved saga, as well as some hilarious comedy bits.\r\n\r\nWith more control over the use of CGI and visual effects, this could very well be one of 2019\u2019s best movies. It still can be, but the climactic final battle lost of a bit of its impact due to the overwhelming VFX which completely overcame the animation itself. The ending is predictable before we reach half-runtime, and the spoiler-heavy trailers didn\u2019t help to keep surprise as a factor. I have to repeat what almost every critic has been saying: if you\u2019re a fan of the saga and you kept up with Super, this will give you everything you want and more. If you\u2019re just a casual moviegoer or if you stopped watching after Z, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t \u201cpoison\u201d social media with opinions on a film that simply wasn\u2019t made for you. \r\n\r\nThank you, Toriyama! Thank you for giving me the chance to see my favorite anime on the big screen for the first time, and for making it epic. Can\u2019t wait for the announcement of the series continuation \u2026\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI love weird movies. The seemingly awkward moments, the apparently nonsensical ambiguity, or simply the pure WTF sequences... All of these leave me deeply captivated by what the story and its filmmaker are trying to transmit to their viewers. The Lighthouse is the most recent addition to the group of psychological horror films that will make you think, \"what the hell am I watching?\" Nevertheless, this is one of the most accessible \"weird flicks\" since most of the story is easily explainable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I hope this Robert Eggers' movie gets a successful home release. Usually, the general public heavily dislikes ambiguous films. Nowadays, people want everything at the palm of their hands before they even watch the movie (aka trailers). So, a film about two lighthouse keepers who go crazy, where dozens of scenes apparently make no sense (they do), can fail to catch the viewers' attention. However, it found mine. Filmed in black-and-white and with a 1.19:1 aspect ratio (almost squared), Eggers delivers a gorgeous-looking piece of cinema.\r\n\r\nPeople tend to (wrongly) associate the use of black-and-white with \"old movies,\" but it's really just another color palette. For example, Blade Runner 2049 and Mad Max: Fury Road use the color yellow in such a beautiful, eyegasmic way. Color can affect us emotionally, psychologically, and even physically, often without us becoming aware. The Lighthouse's black-and-white establishes the film's mood from the very beginning. A very somber, sad, dark environment, filled with creepy seagulls, and brutal weather conditions.\r\n\r\nIf I try to imagine the movie with color, it's not going to be very different from what it actually is. There's no sun, only tons of rain, wind, and waves. It's always cloudy, and inside the house, it's still dark and cold. So, even if Eggers decided to film with color, black, grey, and white would be the predominant tones either way. That's why the decision to make this film in black-and-white is so perfect. Every shot is dripping with visual beauty. Amazing wide shots of Robert Pattinson working like a slave, getting hit by the relentless weather, all accompanied by a haunting score which elevates every sequence.\r\n\r\nIn my point of view, it's a story about how solitude can make anyone run away from reality. Lack of human contact never contributes to a good way of living. Imagining a better life or literally run away to a remote place with a non-stop job to make you forget who you are or what you did, are not going to help anyone overcome what is, in fact, a personal issue. It's a narrative given to many interpretations, so no one is right or wrong. Depending on our life experience and on our distinct personalities, each and every one of us can have a different perspective and understanding of what this movie tells through the Eggers brothers' brilliant screenplay.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: Robert Pattinson and especially Willem Dafoe should be considered for the awards season. However, this film is too weird and ominous to be awarded any nominations, unfortunately. Dafoe is 64-years-old, and he crawls on the muddy ground, he gets hit with rain and literal sh*t in the face, besides delivering a versatile performance. Both he and Pattinson offer a dynamic range of acting, going from absurdly hilarious to intensely dramatic displays. It's probably Pattinson's best performance to date, but Dafoe shines as a crazy old ex-sailor.\r\n\r\nTheir accents are perfect, and Dafoe's ability to \"sing\" complex (linguistically speaking) sea poems for whole uncut takes is worthy of every single Oscar. That's something I wasn't expecting: there's a lot of long takes that become even more impressive due to the actors' undeniable talent. It's been a long time since I had to read subtitles to actually understand what the characters were saying, especially Dafoe. Besides the strong accents, the dialogues are extraordinarily intricate and wordy, which definitely captures my attention since I have to be twice as focused.\r\n\r\nIncredible cinematography, great editing, and a subtle but powerful score. It's a shame if people ignore this movie's existence. It's not getting released in my country, so I'll try my best to make people see it. Unfortunately, it's being ignored by every major award ceremony, which is pretty unfair, having in mind it's one of the best films of 2019. I don't have a single issue with it. Some people might not enjoy its ambiguity or its slow pacing. Still, I genuinely love how everything falls into place, culminating in a shocking, suspenseful, and tense third act that makes the massive build-up worthy of merit.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Lighthouse is one of my favorite movies of 2019. It's definitely going into my Top10, and way up there. Filmed in beautiful black-and-white with a claustrophobic aspect ratio, Robert Eggers delivers a story about loneliness and isolation that takes the weirdest, craziest route. It's one of those WTF films that will leave everyone thinking about it. I love its ambiguity, even if most of its story is pretty accessible. Packed with suspense and tension, mostly due to the excellent cinematography and the brilliant decision to use black-and-white to set the dark, cold environment. Robert Pattinson delivers his career-best performance, but Willem Dafoe steals the spotlight with an Oscar-worthy crazy display that will be ignored due to the known genre bias. It's tear-inducing hilarious at times, but powerfully dramatic as well. I have not a single complaint, and I love it more the more I think about it. Please, watch this at home if you get a chance. Don't miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A+"

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\n2020 is undoubtedly one of the worst years ever for movies, not even in terms of quality, but the infinite delays of highly anticipated films automatically make this year more underwhelming than what it would ever be. Nevertheless, it still delivered a few surprises along the way. Movies that I wasn't really expecting to like as much as I did (Underwater, The Call of the Wild), or even films that I knew I'd enjoy them but eventually end up absolutely loving them (The One and Only Ivan, Palm Springs, The Personal History of David Copperfield). Jacob Chase's feature directorial debut is amongst the former group. I only knew the premise and the cast, which I have to admit didn't really convince me, but I still gave it a go since this could be my last trip to a film theater this year\u2026\r\n\r\nIf it ends up truly being my last time watching a movie on the big screen this year, then it's a wonderful final film. Come Play is one of the biggest surprises of 2020. There are so many aspects that I absolutely love about it, but it doesn't escape from several issues as well. I'll start with the impressive performance of Azhy Robertson (Oliver) as a non-verbal autistic kid. As someone who has shared some time with a young autistic girl, I left the theater fully believing that Azhy was, in fact, autistic in real-life (I didn't recognize him from Marriage Story). I was mind-blown when I found out he wasn't. His display feels so realistic and authentic that I never thought his portrayal was pure acting.\r\n\r\nJohn Gallagher Jr. (Marty) is really good as well, but he doesn't have as much screentime as Gillian Jacobs (Sarah). The latter isn't exactly awful, but she definitely disappoints in the more sentimental moments. She's great during the horror sequences, adding to the suspenseful atmosphere, but when the time comes to really deliver heartfelt dialogues and passionate expressions, Gillian fails to offer a convincing performance. The other kids in the movie are also quite cringe-worthy, but not every young actor can be incredible at such a young age.\r\n\r\nDespite the cast's irregular interpretations, none ruins the captivating story behind Larry, the \"misunderstood monster\" on the other side of the screen. The social commentary is loud and clear, giving the film a whole other layer. Jacob Chase's commitment and dedication to this work (based on his own short) are palpable throughout the runtime, visible through the numerous tiny details spread across each storyline. I found myself astonishingly invested in the narrative. However, Chase often repeats scenes meant to pass that social message he so desperately wants to transmit, transforming many scenes that could be genuine into something extremely forced.\r\n\r\nThis last aspect is compensated with innovative horror sequences with highly creative use of today's technology to generate an incredibly tense environment. There aren't many jumpscares, but most are pretty effective. Nevertheless, it's the suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire movie that elevates the overall horror vibe. Chase also employs long takes, which ultimately leaves viewers at the edge of their seats due to some excellent camera work (Maxime Alexandre) and seamless editing (Gregory Plotkin). I really like the score (Roque Ba\u00f1os), but there are a couple of moments where the almost silent music weirdly becomes an adventure tune.\r\n\r\nAnother brilliant technical decision comes from Chase's work with the VFX team. As expected from a low-budget production, the visual effects would never reach today's standards if they decided to show the monster in plain sight during daylight. If you go into the film expecting a monster movie where the latter is the protagonist, forget it. The crew was intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge the not-that-good VFX quality, so Chase \"hides\" the monster with low lighting and \"shows\" him during night sequences and/or through a smartphone/tablet's camera. It might be a disappointing aspect for many people, but I was delighted with this smart decision.\r\n\r\nIt's more of a family drama than a generic horror flick. There's a fair attempt at delivering something special, and I do believe it was very close to being one of the best films of the year. The treatment of the autistic character is near-perfect. I love the fact that not only the movie shows every problem that a condition like this brings, but it also demonstrates the extraordinary qualities that autistic people possess. Even though he cannot speak, Oliver is exceptionally clever, fun, and brave, something I believe most of today's society doesn't think autistic kids can be. The ending is both bold and surprising, finishing on a significant emotional moment that will leave viewers with a bittersweet reaction.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Come Play is one of my favorite surprises of this year. Jacob Chase proves that he's a dedicated filmmaker who knows his craft. With exceptional preparation, Chase presents an extremely captivating narrative, distinct from the generic horror flicks that flood every year. By focusing on the emotionally compelling story instead of the formulaic jumpscares, the horror sequences have a much more significant impact due to the viewer's connection with the main characters, especially Azhy Robertson's. The latter delivers one of the best young performances of 2020, interpreting an autistic kid with remarkable authenticity. However, the rest of the cast is not up to the task, especially Gillian Jacobs, who disappoints with an overall emotionally underwhelming display. The social commentary is important and efficiently transmitted, despite Chase eventually losing his balance and exaggerating the number of scenes that ultimately become forced. Technically, the suspenseful atmosphere steals the spotlight from the few yet effective jumpscares. Ends with a surprisingly bold, emotionally bittersweet moment. As long as you don't expect a \"monster flick\" packed with predictable scares, I sincerely recommend it to anyone looking for a Halloween plan.\r\n\r\nRating: B+"

Their undercard suffers due to the fact they have so many young wrestlers and they don't leave wrestlers off cards if they are healthy. So you're always going to get the rookie match and the big gaijin tag match, that's life in the Stardom World. But once you get past that, Stardom has some truly amazing wrestlers that would blow the roof off any building in the world if given the chance. Both title matches here delivered, not only in execution but they also left the stories open so no one will be left behind - the stories of Tam Nakano and Momo Watanabe will continue to grow. Whether you watch it on Stardom World or find the Samurai TV version, the second half is certainly worth tracking down, particularly the main event",
