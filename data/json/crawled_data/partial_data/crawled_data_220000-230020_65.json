Jane and Wendy seem to have the most detail put into their animation.  The (classic) crocodile was replaced with an octopus (but still includes a suction cup version of tik-toking) by a visual director that barely understood what an octopus was.\r\n\r\nNow, being that I'm generally opposed to the octopus in general, I happen to know a few things about octopus so giving it snail-like eyes, a beak AND teeth, as well as an over-sized tongue broke me a little.  The behaviors were typically way off, to include swimming with it's arms above water (they typically help with the locomotion) and some weird physics when climbing the boat.\r\n\r\nAlso, we've pretty much pinpointed the inspiration for Neverland Island, which does actually include salt water crocodiles, but as it is in the Caribbean, this Giant Pacific Octopus  is completely out of place.\r\n\r\nThe animation style was also shifting from scene to scene, object to object.  Sometimes it is very jarring, a digital cell character atop a cg rendered log, or other times it's a cg rendered background against the digital cell animation of the ship (or vice versa) that really took me out of it as it just looked so unnatural.  I'll site \"Titan A.E.\" (Fox) and \"Treasure Planet\" (Disney) as too different examples where it was blended much more smoothly.\r\n\r\nI actually like the premise better: Hook kidnap's Wendy's daughter, but the movie does so many weird things.  Even though the original movie was officially set in the 1950s, Wendy grows at least 4-6 years to 18 to have a 12 year old daughter and a (generously) 3 year old boy, but the entire world travels backwards to WW2.  Even if we retro the original setting, make Wendy....30?, that means the original occurred in 1929 at the latest, as this sequel could occur during 1945 at the latest, and I just did more math than I'm comfortable with to enjoy a movie.\r\n\r\nAnd this bad movie has the audacity to drop like real dilemmas in the middle: obligation to family vs trustworthiness, acceptance of others, and this crazy mechanical suggestion about how The Fey of the island work.  Does belief of faeries / pixies matter, is it disbelief that actually harms them?\r\n\r\nLook, this isn't the worst thing to watch, but I honestly kind of regret my time spent on it."

It stars Charlize Theron, Kevin Bacon, Courtney Love, Stuart Townsend, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Dakota Fanning. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography is by Frederick Elmes.\r\n\r\nBased on Iles\u2019 book 24 Hours, Trapped aspires to be a potent kidnap thriller, an attempt to use the kidnapping of a young girl as some sort of edge of the seat entertainment, sadly it\u2019s poorly constructed and quite frankly ill advised.\r\n\r\nA fine cast has assembled for the picture, but nobody distinguishes themselves as they try to make the generic and idiotic material work. On the atmosphere side of the fence things aren\u2019t half bad, there\u2019s a grim and grubby feel to proceedings, but Mandoki consistently ruins each passage of promise with cack-handed convolutions, which when the core plot device is a dumb drug set-up, only makes the feeble efforts of making a twisty thriller even more laughable. The crowning glory of the latter being the finale, which is ludicrous. 2/10 with young Fanning the only one coming out of it with any credit."

I think this is the movie where John McEnroe started getting involved.\r\n\r\n The character work in this is either drastically good or drastically bad, and they definitely experimented with some ideas they had in the backlog.\r\n\r\nThe \"rags to riches\" trope crossed with the \"NYC is a cesspool of money corruption\" trope is actually inspired.  There is a great script in this movie, behind all the Sandler style humor, but that humor does make it fun, I just wish there was an adjustable setting sometimes.\r\n\r\nUltimately anything that isn't funny or charming in this is brief enough that you can overlook it pretty easily."

That's not to say it's anything incredibly revolutionary, but it's a premise that they could've done so much more with. I won't spoil what the main thing is, but it's certainly interesting. The first half of the film is excellent, it just disappointingly doesn't go that extra mile.\r\n\r\nAlexis Bledel (how the heck is that <i>not</i> Robin Tunney?!) is enjoyable as Winnie, while Jonathan Jackson does well as Jesse. Ben Kingsley is, at least in my opinion, the best performer on display - I love the look of his character, who is elusively only referred to as \"The Man in the Yellow Suit\". Huge potential there.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I come way from this feeling underwhelmed - despite the film doing a lot of positive things, including the score. Shame."

For a movie that most certainly contains both those two things (the latter in especially heavy doses), I actually didn't mind _Van Wilder_ that much. But it's all about context, if instead of comparing it to a list of similar things that I hate you compared it to, say, the entire history of cinema overall, then _National Lampoon's Van Wilder_ is pretty bad.\r\n\r\nOne additional note, the friend of mine who I put this on for told me that the movie was from the era of \"When Tara Reid was still hot\". Now personally I've never found any iteration of her attractive, but it did make me have a parallel thought, is Van Wilder from the era when Tara Reid was a better actor? I'm not saying she has been some sort of Oscar-worthy great at any stage, but if I compare her in this to her in, for example, _Sharknado 47_, despite the extra years of experience, she's definitely worse now, right?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

To be fair, no only is this in that string of unnecessary sequels that Disney did, it is right after they switched from classic cell animation to digital cell animation, but it was 2 years after \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" and that looks amazing.\r\n\r\nThe other immediate problem (even on the cover) is that Mowgli is still wearing his mystery diaper (never established where it came from) instead of actual clothes.\r\n\r\nAs Mowgli struggles with being of two worlds (an arguably great point from the original movie), he extends his entitled behavior to returning to the Jungle, aggravating the village, as Sher Khan returns to hunting Mowgli, extending his obsession / pride (sort of a Moby Dick thing).\r\n\r\nLacking some creativity, they return to some of the old songs (3 that I can think of, \"Bear Necessities\" and \"Jungle Rhythm\" being over used, and \"I Wanna Be Like You\" at the credits of all places) instead of using original material.\r\n\r\nAs the adventures continue it's reveal that Mowgli had no natural connection to the animals, it's just that EVERYTHING speaks English, the other human characters don't bat an eye or lose a beat.  It completely ruins the movie.  At least in Tarzan it was clear he would \"ooh ooh\" to the Guerillas.  What little charm they were able to drag from the previous movie to this one is just destroyed by that.\r\n\r\nThe dramatization of Mowgli's endangerment also has a lesser impact this time, as he's survived before, and this time around we also have 2 other hapless children running about the Jungle who must have been blessed with invincibility to survive all that they do.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying there isn't something to enjoy here, but there is a lot more that I didn't, and there are far too many other movies to see."

As always with serial killer films, you hope that the subject is handled in such a way so as to justify you having invested time in it. Matthew Bright\u2019s instalment into the hall of shame legacy left by one Theodore Robert Bundy, is uncompromising and unforgettable. Could the charge of exploitation be levelled at Bright and his backers? No, I don\u2019t think so.\r\n\r\nThe advent of time where film is concerned has seen film makers now be able to tackle difficult subjects for maximum impact. Bright, in the main, follows the real life of Bundy and his vile crimes. His home life and trail of destruction are covered graphically, so if anyone was in any doubt about the measure of Bundy\u2019s evil via previous film, TV or literary interpretations? Then this is the gaping wound of Bundy tellings, with salt poured in.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s nigh on impossible to recommend as an essential viewing experience, I myself haven\u2019t been able to get some of the images out of my head some 5 days after watching it. But that\u2019s the point, surely? Some minor fabrications aside (we cheer the events just prior to the electrocution, but it didn\u2019t happen), this is one of the best films of the bloody sub-genre of horror it sits in. For impact and Michael Reilly Burke\u2019s bold and scary performance as Bundy, it has artistic merit. If you have the stomach for it that is. 8/10"

It is however hard to look past the patronising and mildly offensive portrayal of the idiot savant Duddits, and the ending is completely stupid.

            "review": "***Powerful message in a melancholic drama bogged down by un-real contrivances and other issues*** \r\n\r\nA father and son (Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger) are correctional officers in Louisiana who live with their father, a former corrections officer and hateful racist (Peter Boyle). After overseeing the execution of a black man (Sean 'Diddy' Combs) a couple of tragedies compel the father, Hank (Thornton), to meet the struggling ex-wife of the executed man (Halle Berry).\r\n\r\nThe cast, locations, score and directing are all excellent. The problem is the contrived script, which tends to focus on the worst in humanity and sometimes creates a feeling of surreal un-reality. As far as the former goes, the first half features ugly racism, prostitution (and the corresponding overt sex scene), hate, a prison execution, an unforeseen suicide and a sudden hit-and-run. If you can handle all that in the first 55 minutes, you might appreciate this movie.\r\n\r\nSome of these sequences work (the prostitute scene and the execution) and some don\u2019t (the racism, suicide and hit-and-run). The latter ones have a sense of unreality either because of dubious writing or weak execution, or both. Take, for instance, the racist remarks by the old patriarch (Boyle). They come off unbelievable and laughable (or maybe they wanted them to come off laughable?). With better writing/acting/directing they would\u2019ve worked.  Or take the hit-and-run: it\u2019s totally off-camera; and the segue into the aftermath is weak. The viewer is left asking, \u201cWhat just happened? Did I miss something?\u201d As for the suicide, it was just unconvincing in more than one way.\r\n\r\nHalle won an Oscar for her performance, but I found her miscast. She was too white, too intelligent and too young/gorgeous for the role. As for being \u201ctoo white,\u201d her son would\u2019ve had lighter skin. In regards to being \u201ctoo intelligent,\u201d when she has a long talk with Hank on the couch I didn\u2019t buy her character. It came across as an obviously enlightened Berry ACTING uneducated and low class. As for being too young/hot, are we to believe she\u2019s been drinkin\u2019 and smokin\u2019 for ELEVEN YEARS waiting for her former husband to be put to death without any dudes sniffin\u2019 around and no worse for the wear? She should\u2019ve been made up to look older or, at least, more drained. Instead, she looks fresh and thoroughly beautiful from head-to-toe.\r\n\r\nDespite all these considerable negatives, the movie conveys a well thought-out message and contains some worthy intricacies, not to mention it refuses idiotic political correctness. For instance, the prisoner honestly admits what he did was wrong and accepts his fate as just, even while he\u2019s clearly repentant. Moreover, the wife wants nothing to do with him and only visits for the sake of their son.\r\n\r\nA critic wrongly argued that a certain character was a hardcore racist and wouldn\u2019t have such a \u201csudden change of heart.\u201d Well, this critic wasn\u2019t watching closely. At the beginning of the movie this character was well into the process of metamorphosizing from his father\u2019s odious mindset. Yes, he does something hateful with his rifle near the opening, but this was a PERFORMANCE for his dad who was peering through the window with approval. In short, the hateful patriarch still exercised his insufferable iron will over the family even while he was restricted to a wheelchair and stroller. The film\u2019s about freeing oneself of that power and that hate; and much more.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 51 minutes and was shot in Laplace, Louisiana, and Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

            "review": "_**Is it really about aliens?**_\r\n\r\nM. Night Shyamalan's \"Signs\" (2002) is about a disillusioned ex-minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in their cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!\r\n\r\nAlthough the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: (1) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And (2) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.\r\n\r\nThe film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give-in to the former.\r\n\r\nThis is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.\r\n\r\nMany people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).\r\n\r\n**SPOILER ALERT** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the \"father of lies\".\r\n\r\nThere are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called \"the prince of the power of the air\" in the bible). The \"aliens\" look decidedly demonic and have cloven hoofs. The \u201cprimitive method\u201d of repelling the aliens is discovered in \u201cthree cities the Middle East\u201d and is holy water, which is ordinarily used by Catholic & Episcopal exorcists against demonic manifestations (Shyamalan, by the way, attended Catholic & Episcopal schools). The daughter, Bo, was said to be a \"gift from God\" who is sensitive to impure (unholy) water. Her name in Old Norse means \"to live\" and she was able to discern the weapon of life needed to defeat the demonic menace. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. The crop circle in the Hess cornfield resembles a pitchfork. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God in order to converse. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the \"aliens\" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.\r\n\r\nAlso, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The \"alien\" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.\r\n\r\nAlso, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The \"alien\" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet after the death of the minister's wife.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that when the film debuted, Shyamalan was known as the king of the plot twist, yet the revelation that the aliens\u2019 weakness is water wasn\u2019t exactly a mind-blowing turn seeing as how the earth is 71% water and technologically advanced aliens who can travel the galaxy would know this. Moreover, the aliens curiously have no physical weapons and are easily trapped by a pantry door. It stands to reason that Shyamalan hid the twist in the movie. That twist is that the aliens are really demonic in nature.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying you can't view the movie as a literal extra-terrestrial invasion flick, but rather that the underlying demonic reading is a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together and links to the story arc of the disillusioned ex-minister finding redemption. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This is a quality Shyamalan film and is about on par with \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"The Village.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

            "review": "Ang Lee helped revolutionize superhero related films forever with Hulk (2003). Rather than just have the hero try to save the world, Lee and James Schamus decided to have Bruce Banner deal with his Freudian psychology, specifically the repressed memories he had thirty years ago about his father.\r\n\r\nThe acting talents of Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott and Josh Lucas are perfect for the five main characters. Bana was able to do intentional wooden acting to hide his character's repressed emotions while Connelly conveyed kindness as her Oscar winning role from A Beautiful Mind (2001).\r\n\r\nWhat I loved about Lee's interpretation is that he did not care about faithfulness. He cared about showing a cerebral kind of superhero film that later got imitated with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), Watchmen (2009), Logan (2017), Dawn of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016).\r\n\r\nAng Lee is one of the best directors to have ever lived and Hulk is one of many films he directed for great proof."

It feels like it actually has a richer, more complex story to it with a better message of cooperation and right over wrong, but it relies too heavily on weird effects combined with a lack of technology working in the story.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets it apart is cross competitiveness with a secondary kid team, which was really cool to suddenly see a young Emily Osment (\"Young and Hungry\").  And Steve Buscemi shows up as a mad scientist which is interesting all to itself.\r\n\r\nThe movie has its high points, but I feel like you spend far more time in the valleys."

Directed by Steve Beck and starring Gabriel Byrne, Desmond Harrington, Ron Eldard and Julianna Margulies, plot finds a salvage crew discovering a long lost passenger liner out in the remote Bering Sea. With the laws of the sea stating that they can keep what they find, they are delighted to find gold on board. But it\u2019s not long before strange things start to happen.\r\n\r\nIt starts of real well with a bloody and gruesome prelude, the production design is super and everything is in place for a chiller out there in the foggy waters. Unfortunately what we actually get is a predictable series of clich\u00e9s cribbed from better movies of the past, none of which capable of eliciting a genuine scare. The makers think that having a bombastic techno score accompanying the dramatic moments will make them appear more shocking. It doesn\u2019t, while the cast are ill served by direction and writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorror 101 for beginners. 3/10"

            "review": "I am not a man. I began as one, but now I am becoming more than a man, as you will witness. \r\n\r\nRed Dragon is based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris and is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It stars Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary-Louise Parker & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Dante Spinotti is on cinematography and Danny Elfman scores the music.\r\n\r\nRed Dragon is a prequel to the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs. The story had already been filmed as Manhunter in 1986 directed by Michael Mann. The signs weren't particularly good for Red Dragon. The previous year had seen Ridley Scott tackle Silence Of The Lambs follow up, Hannibal, with tepid results. While at the helm here was the director of such fodder as Rush Hour 1&2, and of course Mann's take on the story is viewed as a grainy and skin itching cult classic. Nice to report then that even tho it's hardly in the same class as \"Lambs,\" it's a willing entertainer that genuinely manages to unease.\r\n\r\nFirstly one has to get past the Hannibal Lecter factor to fully enjoy (and dampen expectations) the movie on its own terms. Lecter (Hopkins enjoying himself but going through the motions) is a secondary character. Important? Yes! But still secondary to Norton's troubled but gifted FBI agent Will Graham and Fiennes bonkers serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (AKA:The Tooth Fairy). Red Dragon is first and foremost a ripping good old detective story, with Ratner and Tally wisely using the bits that made Harris' novel such a page turning success. They have added their own bits of course {the pre-credit sequence involving Lecter & Graham sets things up perfectly}, but ultimately it's a loyal enough telling of a gripping and goose flesh inducing story.\r\n\r\nThe makers have wisely filled the film out with quality performers. Norton underplays Graham nicely, a character unable to stay away from the job that threatens his family, he becomes an easy guy to root for as things start to get troubling. Fiennes too doesn't go over the top, in great physical shape and with piercing blue eyes, he exudes menace without resorting to being a cackling caricature. Hoffman was a shoe in for a weasel reporter since he does it so well, while Keitel, tho not having to stretch himself, offers up a stoic turn as Jack Crawford. But the main performance, and sadly unheralded, comes from Emily Watson as the blind Reba. With Reba acting as both a romantic and redemptive foil to Dolarhyde's split-personality, Watson gets the tough gig, and comes up trumps with an affecting turn featuring the right amounts of spunk, sadness and needy tenderness.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit too polished to be a nerve shredder, with Ratner unable to give the film an atmospheric feel befitting the darkness at its core. But it does deliver on the promise of not only that opening segment, but also on Harris' fine procedural narrative. 7/10"

Mackye Gruber. It stars Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz and Ethan Suplee. Music is by Michael Suby and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe title refers to the butterfly effect, the chaos theory of a popular hypothetical situation that illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time. The plot pitches Kutcher as Evan Treborn who suffers blackouts during critical mments in his life. When older he finds that through reading the journals he has written since a child, that he can go back in time to the significant events and change what happens. Unfortunately each time he does it comes at a great cost...\r\n\r\nIt was mercilessly kicked by the pro critics upon release, not helped by coming at a time when Kucher was something of a kicking post to critics. To compound the misery for the makers, they released a theatrical cut that featured a quite apalling ending. Inspite of these trevails at the time of release, the pic made a pot load of cash at the box office. Once the Directors Cut surfaced, with a key scene added to cement the different - quality - ending, time has seen the stock of the pic rise considerably. So much so that it currently sits at a 7.6 rating on IMDb and a 75% rating on TMDB, wile there are some critics who have come out and admitted they were too quick to judge the first release back in 2004.\r\n\r\nWhat we have is a time travelling corkscrew narrative that is immensely sombre in telling how ones actions can have far-reaching consequences. It's a compelling and often thrilling picture, one that can spark hearty debate about the thematics at work - notably we the audience being forced to contemplate our own actions in life. The pic demands the utmost attention, switching off for a few minutes is a definite no no. Some scenes linger long in the memory as we trawl through the evil that kids and men do, right up to the unforgettable finale.\r\n\r\nThere's plot and logic holes, that are small irritants, and even though this definitely could have been better cast with more senior actors, none of the youthful cast members hurt the picture. It packs a punch, that is on proviso you only see the directors cut. 7.5/10"

            "review": "_**Deviates too much from the comic and has a boring midsection**_\r\n\r\nMarvel Comics' Man-Thing is a mindless, empathic swamp creature that lives in the Everglades. This 2005 film is loosely based on the story \"Cry of the Native\" from the 1973 comic (Adventure Into) Fear #16, which featured the Man-Thing, by writer Steve Gerber and Howland, Ohio's Val Mayerik (artist).\r\n\r\nThe plot's great: The Seminoles and environmentalists are upset over a developer taking over their precious swamp. A new police chief comes into town and has to deal with the situation, as well as investigate an increasing number of horrifying deaths in the swamp and reports of a \"man-thing\" creature living there.\r\n\r\nThe swamp sets, cinematography, music, locations (Sydney, Australia, of all places) and cast are all quite good. This is not a Grade-Z movie. As a matter of fact, it was originally intended for theatrical release.\r\n\r\nThe film has a good mysterious feel to it, in particular the first 30 minutes and final 20 minutes. The vibe, to be expected, is very comic booky, but the material is respected and generally taken seriously, avoiding the rut of camp.\r\n\r\nWhat works best is the \"Man-Thing\" itself; imagine Val Mayerik's rendition of the creature with a bunch of creepy branches & roots sticking out of its back & head and you'd have a pretty good idea of what ol' Manny looks like in this film: He's an 8-foot tall, hulking, and utterly horrifying piece of man-like swamp mass.\r\n\r\nNow for what doesn\u2019t work. Although the Man-Thing looks great, which is a cinematic triumph in and of itself, he doesn't appear fully until the last 20 minutes. This would be fine if the story were captivating, like say \"Jaws,\" but it's not. Although the plot's great, the story itself barely holds your attention after the first half hour and is unnecessarily convoluted with pointless characters. The middle-hour is wasted on various people hanging out in the swamp for one dubious reason or another, half of them getting picked off by the creature. I'm sure they did this to show-off the superb swamp sets and lighting, etc., but they forgot the most important part, an interesting story and characters. This makes no sense since Gerber's run on the comic contains a wealth of great material to use for compelling scripts.\r\n\r\nAlso, the film deviates too far from Man-Thing's original concept. Some new ideas introduced are great, like the way the creature looks and horrifically attacks people, but where's Manny's empathic nature? Where's the \"whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch\" element? And why does Manny kill people indistinguishably? For instance, the creature kills a noble native at one point and later threatens the two protagonists of the story. The Man-Thing never did this in the comics even though he was a mindless creature. In other words, he was a force for good, figuratively representing nature and, more specifically, the swamp. However, this CAN be related to the movie as well, if you think about it.\r\n\r\nSome things are sort of faithful to the comics. For instance, Ted Sallis is linked to the creature and I actually like the change in the movie compared to the eye-rolling \u201csuper soldier\u201d serum angle of the comics.\r\n\r\nFor those not in the know, the first Marvel comic featuring the Man-thing beat out DC's Swamp Thing by two months in 1971. To complicate matters, the cover of The Phantom Stranger #14 features a creature that looks suspiciously like Man-Thing (albeit NOT the corresponding story inside the comic) and this issue was released the same month that Man-Thing debuted in Savage Tales #1. In any case, Theodore Sturgeon's similar swamp creature \"It\" appeared in one of his short stories 31 years earlier! The first comic book bog beast, The Heap, appeared two years later in 1942, obviously inspired by Sturgeon's creature.\r\n\r\nLet's compare \"Man-Thing\" with the similar \"Swamp-Thing\" from 1982. To be expected, the creature from \"Man-Thing\" absolutely blows away the guy-in-a-rubber-suit in \"Swamp-Thing.\" The sets, atmosphere and cinematography of \"Man-Thing\" are also better than \"Swamp-Thing,\" not to mention the vibe's not as goofy. As for the story, I would say they're about equal.\r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS: The midsection of \"Man-Thing\" is lethargic and meandering, filled with uninteresting or undeveloped characters, but the film's attributes noted above make it worth checking out if you're into creature-on-the-loose flicks, particularly of the swamp monster variety. On that level it's a decent movie. The greatest part is the creature itself, which is a cinematic triumph, especially if you're a fan of the comic books. But these same fans will be disappointed because the film is a very loose interpretation with an utterly tedious midsection. It's too bad because the potential for greatness was there.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

Juli\u00e1n wrestles with dark memories of the death of his son, also a stuntman, and with estrangement from his daughter-in-law Laura and her son Carlos.

But when Laura, a powerful executive looking for a new site for a tourist resort, learns that Carlos has joined the hated Juli\u00e1n, she moves to destroy even this remnant of Juli\u00e1n's once-proud career.

Some of us make money off that and others get destroyed.  \r\n\r\nBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead is directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Kelly Masterson. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Ron Fortunato.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers with differing financial problems plan to rob their parents' jewellery store. But when all does not go to plan and tragedy strikes, it sends them, and those close to them, into a world of fear, shame and violence...\r\n\r\nIt opens with a raunchy sex scene, man and wife in the throes of committed passion, for these brief moments there is pleasure. Once over, though, it proves to be a false dawn, the last time anyone on screen will taste pleasure in Lumet's biting morality tale. From here on in the film unfolds in a dizzying array of multi-perspectives and over lapping of narrative structure, a three pronged assault on the senses as a family implodes in a haze of greed, lies and inadequacies. A botched robbery underpins the plotting, the aftermath of which is what is most cutting, we zip around learning the wherewithal and whys of the key players, learning exactly what we need to know to fully immerse in this bleak world. This is a world populated by love cheats, drug abuse, embezzling, bad parenting and blackmail, a world where the brothers Hanson (Hoffman & Hawke) now dwell, either ill equipped (Hawke's Hank) or stuck between idiocy and smug evil (Hoffman's Andy). Their folly, their greed, impacting with a juddering severity on the family circle.\r\n\r\nMy life, it doesn't add up. Nothing connects to anything else. I'm not the sum of my parts. All my parts don't add up to one...me.\r\n\r\nIt would be Lumet's last film (he passed away in 2011), thankfully it is a fitting final offering from the talented Philadelphian. He's aided considerably, mind, by a razor sharp script from debut screenplay writer Masterton. It's full of nastiness and tension, but still observational as a family tragedy, with major bonus' being that it never resorts to stereotypes or cops out come the crushing denouement. Where Lumet excels is in drawing near faultless performances from his cast. Youthful and downtrodden haplessness portrayed by Hawke, Hoffman's powerhouse manipulator with emotional issues, Tomei proving that over 40 is still sexy while dialling into a very touching performance. Finney, a cracker-jack of grief from the wily old fox, Ryan's hard edged ex-wife and Michael Shannon strolling into the picture late in the day exuding notable menace. All splendidly guided by the great director who asks them to portray characters convincing in going deeper for motivations and means.\r\n\r\nBleak, brutal and near brilliant across the board. 9/10"

It's a drama, comedy and romantic, and a great looking cast. The stage production was fabulous, it's so much better watching it on the big screen. \r\n\r\nThe phantom being the villain, you just feel for him and his love for Christine. Not to mention that fact that he's so hot. That's something I wasn't expecting. I couldn't keep my eyes off him. \r\n\r\nThe movie is stunning, the music absolutely superb. The cast WOW especially Gerard...what a hunk. \r\n\r\nI must say I bought the DVD, which had extras of the original phantom with the original stage cast. The movie I think is so much better. Gerard is superb, his emotional state was so believable. As were the rest of the cast. I still cry at the final scene.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a movie to watch and don't forget the tissue.\r\n\r\nA wonderful love story. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius and I've fallen in love with Gerard.\r\n\r\n(This was my only IMDB review and I pinched it back)"

His head is as big as Barry Bonds!\r\n\r\nAh look, as you have most likely heard by now, this is not as good as the first two films and it's just a little bit tired in formula. However, it's still a bunch of fun if you already buy into the fastest mouth/fastest hands pairing of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. The plot is incidental, thus simple, and the emphasis here is more on fun than electrifying action. Though the finale here is edge of the seat exciting and laugh inducing in equal measure. There's some truly good one liners thrown out and the chemistry between the two actors is still very much evident.\r\n\r\nUndemanding it is for sure, even disposable if it was to be judged as a single action/comedy entry, but it closes the trilogy down safe enough and the smile should rarely leave your face upon viewing. 6.5/10"
