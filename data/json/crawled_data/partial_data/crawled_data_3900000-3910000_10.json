It was a perfectly fine match but it had little chance of being better than the two matches that came before it as while both have a lot of spunk they aren't on the same level as Nakajima, Fujimoto, Sakura, etc. Yuuka in particular is still growing, seems like a bit of a stretch to put her in the main event of their biggest show but they must see a lot in her down the road. The emotion was there by the wrestlers and Sera has gotten a mean streak recently, but the transitions were shaky and I never brought into Yuuka having a chance of winning. Solid and fun, but that is about as far as it went.",

After Alpha Female was unexpectedly added to the \u201cMutiny\u201d lineup, fans bombarded WSU Management with messages demanding this international dream match. We have gone out of our way to accommodate these requests.  Because of Shanna\u2019s cooperation, WSU Management has agreed to reward Portugal\u2019s Perfect Athlete by letting her hand-pick her new opponent for \u201cMutiny.\u201d Shanna will now team with Chris Dickinson against Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan in an intergender tag team match that will have major implications on May\u2019s \u201cQueen and King of the Ring\u201d Mixed Tag Team Tournament.",

It's a reboot that basically follows on from the original Gojira film of 1954. Plot has Godzilla back as a destroyer of mankind, setting its eyes on stomping Tokyo into oblivion. As Zilla goes about its destructive way, and Tokyo attempts to repel the onslaught, there's a backdrop of a diplomatic crisis reaching boiling point as the Soviets and the Americans get ready for nuclear war. Thankfully the Japanese are able to convince the sane politicians that it is in fact Godzilla at the crux of things. Can the world powers join together to defeat the mightiest of lizards?\r\n\r\nIf a Godzilla fan you could be forgiven for going into this one fearing the worst, and yet it ticks many of the boxes for those who prefer Zilla as the destroyer of mankind as opposed to the saviour of mankind that the Showa period ended up as. There's the standard amount of miniatures and sets destruction, splendidly constructed as usual, nifty effects work and a whole bunch of iconic images to take from the experience (Zilla atomic breath destruction, stomping through the city, nuclear reinvigoration, back from the dead with awesome carnage following). There's good sci-fi within as well, such as the Japanese scientists having created a super fortress known as Super X, while sometimes all you need is to hear that brilliant roar followed by lizard devastation.\r\n\r\nThis was a return to the dark roots of Godzilla, complete with anti-nuclear sentiments. It didn't reinvent the wheel, but it did restart it successfully. 7/10"
