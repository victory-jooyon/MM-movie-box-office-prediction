            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI went to this movie not expecting much, but it never crossed my mind that I would be watching a film as bad or worse than The Nun. Honestly, going back, I was too easy on the latter since I didn\u2019t exactly give it a massively negative review, which it surely deserves. However, Annabelle Comes Home really tries its best to be even worse. I hate it. I truly do. The horror genre has been exponentially growing, and it\u2019s one of the two most popular genres right now (comic-book movies are the other), but this cheap, bland, cliche, predictable, and forgettable class of horror films is genuinely starting to annoy and frustrate me. The Conjuring Universe became just a set of silly spin-offs with entities that have no interest whatsoever and filled with extremely under-developed characters.\r\n\r\nThis is the third movie about Annabelle. Three films that address the powers of a freaking doll. Three! Very few people liked the first one, the prequel was admittedly a pleasant surprise, but this one is just atrociously bad. There\u2019s not even a story. The whole movie is based on repeating almost laughable jump scares sequences. Literally, it\u2019s all some sort of variation of the following:\r\n\r\nCharacter walks down the hall -> A strange noise occurs-> Character slowly follows that noise -> Score starts to become louder -> Character checks something and camera closes in on the actor\u2019s face -> Score becomes heavier and louder with the introduction of bass -> Another noise occurs behind the character -> Camera pans with the character and nothing happens -> Character continues to check on something -> Another noise, another pan, nothing again -> Score is reaching its climax -> Character continues doing the same thing -> Final noise, pan, and then one out of the two predictable jump scares happen: BOO! or Fake! \u2026 BOO! -> These are accompanied by a ridiculously loud sound that everyone in the theater is already bracing for because, guess what, everyone knows it\u2019s coming -> Cut -> Repeat.\r\n\r\nExcept for the first 15-20 minutes, which are used to solely provide backstory to the three main characters, every single scene is an uninspired, unimaginative, anticipated, and tedious build-up to a jump scare that heavily relies on an exaggeratedly loud sound, and someone screaming. There\u2019s no real narrative besides some character backstories which also have their own issues, especially one that involves an attempt at the start of a silly romance. Gary Dauberman tried to insert comedy in order to balance an otherwise monotonous film, but he failed miserably. Every supposedly funny moment is astonishingly cringe-worthy. It was his directorial feature-debut, and it shows.\r\n\r\nIt just feels like another cheap horror flick, filled with nothing but jump scares. One after the other. Every director in Hollywood could have done this, there\u2019s no distinct style or a trademark shot. Nothing. I do believe that every movie takes a lot of work, and there are tons of people behind a film that genuinely give it their all every time. But Annabelle Comes Home feels so much like a pure cash grab, and I hate writing these words because every movie ever is ultimately an attempt to win money for the studios. However, this sequel never feels like it\u2019s actually serving any purpose for the expansion or improvement of the universe it represents. It\u2019s a horror flick filmed in just one location, something that I usually love because you can do so much with it, but this time it really seems that it was filmed entirely at a house because it was cheaper, hence more probability of profit.\r\n\r\nThere are two clear areas in the horror genre: the zone with films like Hereditary, Get Out and Us, where the story and its characters are what\u2019s more important and scarier; and the other with movies like The Nun, The Curse of La Llorona or Annabelle Comes Home, where the only goal is to cyclically produce jump scare sequences with no narrative significance or impact. If you enjoy this latter type of films (which is absolutely okay, everything is subjective to personal preferences), then you\u2019ll probably enjoy this movie. At least, people in my theater screamed and laughed pretty hard with no respect for the moviegoers that were trying to watch the actual film. However, if you\u2019re sick of watching the same thing over and over and over and over again, please, for your own sake, skip it.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the truly amazing performances, this could very easily be the worst movie of the year (Serenity still holds that spot). McKenna Grace is phenomenal as Judy! Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife are also pretty good at their roles. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga barely have any screentime, but when they do show up, they definitely elevate the scene. Everything related to the production design is quite good, but technicalities will never save a film from misery if the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are thrown down the sewer. Also, I was shocked when I discovered that this is Rated R. There\u2019s barely any blood or anything that justifies that type of rating. It\u2019s another aspect that makes this film an even bigger disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Annabelle Comes Home is as poor or worse than The Nun. I can\u2019t really decide which one I would watch instead of the other because I truly don\u2019t want to watch any of these ever again. A brilliant cast might save this movie from a completely negative review, but it\u2019s still an atrociously cheap addition to the horror genre. Everyone knows why this film doesn\u2019t work: continuously repeating predictable, loud, and hollow jump scare sequences is not a story. I can\u2019t feel invested in any of these scenes if they lack narrative impact or a minimum level of scariness. The fact that I barely even instinctively flinched (something I can\u2019t really avoid) is a sign of how horrible this movie is. My expectations for The Conjuring 3 just dropped tremendously. Good luck, James Wan. You\u2019re going to need it.\r\n\r\nRating: D"

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\n2018 was a disappointing year for me. A lot of letdowns regarding my most anticipated movies, and not enough surprises throughout the year. 2019, on the other hand, has been quite interesting. Most blockbusters have resonated with me, and they\u2019ve been my favorite films to watch so far (Avengers: Endgame, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Us, Glass). Additionally, original low-budget flicks have also caught my eye, and I\u2019ve been enjoying them as well, even if they\u2019re no masterpieces (Greta, Long Shot). Although, I had some bad experiences as well (Dark Phoenix, Hellboy, Godzilla: King of the Monsters). \r\n\r\nCrawl, which I honestly expected just to be a cliche-filled silly horror movie, joins this last group, and it\u2019s on par with Long Shot as the best surprise of 2019, until now. First of all, this is not a typical horror film, at least having in mind the last few examples of the genre. People might go in expecting something along the lines of Annabelle Comes Home, but with alligators, so I might as well moderate those thoughts. I wouldn\u2019t even place it in that genre, even though disaster-horror isn\u2019t exactly a bad description. It\u2019s definitely a suspense movie, almost like a survival-thriller. Haley and Dave have to fight for their lives in a race against both a hurricane and fatal predators, so I wouldn\u2019t generally put this in the horror genre. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nI love this type of films, you know that. Suspenseful, claustrophobic sequences, straightforward plot, and set in (mostly) just one location. You might think that since it\u2019s only one place to shoot and it\u2019s such a simple concept, it\u2019s easier overall, but it couldn\u2019t be more distant from the truth. With high-budget, multiple-location movies, directors and screenwriters can hide their technical flaws with tremendous VFX or huge set pieces. In one location, especially such a small one like a modest house, there\u2019s no hiding. If you want to deliver an entertaining and captivating story, you have to write an enthralling screenplay. If you want to provide scary and efficient jump scare scenes, you need to show some creativity and prove you\u2019re a talented filmmaker.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Aja, who doesn\u2019t exactly has a remarkable filmography, showcases that even with such a simplistic and short idea, it\u2019s possible to be as or more fun than a massive blockbuster. Less than 20 minutes into the film, and we\u2019re on. There\u2019s enough backstory and characterization of the main protagonist for the audience to not only care about Haley but understand what skills she has that will help her survive what comes next. I love small details like zooming in on her locking a door, closing a window, moving a piece of furniture \u2026 Every shot has meaning because it will affect the plot later on. Aja is not shooting something \u201cjust because\u201d, and that\u2019s a skill that a lot of directors struggle to have nowadays since they feel that the runtime needs to be close to the two-hour mark.\r\n\r\nAfter so many dumb, cliche, and horribly performed jump scare sequences in previous horror flicks from this year, I finally got to watch a movie where the director knows how to truly scare people, and make them jump out of their chairs. There are no loud soundtrack noises to make you screech. There are no demons or monsters in front of the screen, screaming like crazy. I was at the edge of my seat for more than a couple of times, and I genuinely got scared on some particular moments, where the surprise factor (Aja doesn\u2019t follow the cheap timings of most horror scenes) and the creativity behind the camera were top notch.\r\n\r\nObviously, the VFX and overall production design aren\u2019t mind-blowing. The alligators look pretty real, and that was the main goal, so mission accomplished. Also, being Rated-R helps the film to deliver great alligator attacks with tons of blood, and the injuries our characters have to deal with are pretty gnarly and disgusting (that\u2019s a compliment). Filming in water is extremely hard, especially in such a confined space. However, Aja and his crew were able to produce a movie where you can understand everything that\u2019s going on for the entire runtime. \r\n\r\nKaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper deliver great performances and show amazing chemistry. Their characters have enough development, even if they don\u2019t have that imaginative scripts. Crawl is one of those films where I can\u2019t point out a preeminent issue with it because it\u2019s good at every aspect. I mean, sure, there are a couple of rare moments of extreme survival, where we might think \u201che/she should be dead\u201d, but it\u2019s such a fun and entertaining time at the theater that we can let go of one or two over-the-top scenes. It\u2019s not like The Meg, where every single moment is unrealistic as hell. The success of the fictional part of a fiction movie depends on its realistic foundation and limits. If these aren\u2019t well-established, then the film will be all over the place, and its viewers won\u2019t know what to believe or not.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Crawl is one of 2019\u2019s best surprises, and I definitely recommend to see it in theaters. With compelling leads and a simple concept, Alexandre Aja delivers an entertaining, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and technically creative movie. Finally, someone who knows how to handle a camera, and provide genuinely scary jump scare sequences. Hopefully, this can catapult Kaya Scodelario to grab a bigger role on a more impactful film. I can\u2019t point out any \u201cflaws\u201d, it\u2019s simply a \u201cgood movie\u201d. With such a low-budget, give a chance to this one, and watch it instead of a massive blockbuster that will probably leave you disappointed with the numerous cliches and the extreme focus on silly action or huge set pieces as a replacement for a good story. Good job, Paramount!\r\n\r\nRating: B+"
