Beautifully filmed, one walks away from Buddha Wild with vivid, memorable images etched in their mind.  I have actually watched this film, end to end, four times.  Each time, I come away with little details I didn't catch before.  A great introduction for anyone first discovering Asian cultures, and equally satisfying for those well versed in Buddhism.  It plays brilliantly on the big screen, but is also compelling on DVD."

I particularly like Willis' look for the majority of the film, he genuinely looks how his character supposedly is - good acting, but also some nice make-up etc. \r\n\r\nMos Def is solid, I remember liking him when he appeared on <em>'Dexter'</em> - I rate him less here, just because of the annoying voice he has; which grates hard at times. Speaking of that Showtime television show, Angel Batista himself (David Zayas) also appears which is cool. David Morse, meanwhile, makes for an OK villain - the casting perhaps could've been greater for the antagonist, mind.\r\n\r\nNone of the plot is all that shocking or surprising, every crossroad that appears is pretty simple to predict where it's heading. Also, maybe I'm the only one who felt this, but there's one moment on a bus where it seems as if Jack is about to unleash some unbelievable secret plan but it just fizzles out into oddly nothing. Might be just me.\r\n\r\nAll in all though, I reckon you'll be able to find a satisfactory 105 minutes with this - I did, at least."

            "review": "***The best of the Punisher movies with a weak last act***\r\n\r\nThe Punisher first appeared in the Spider-Man comic in February, 1974, and became a semi-regular foe/ally in that mag, but was more apt to appear in Daredevil in the 80s until the character got his own mini-series in 1986 and then his ongoing titles: The Punisher (1987), The Punisher War Journal (1988) and The Punisher War Zone (1992). The character was so popular at the time that he inspired a black & white magazine as well (1989).\r\n\r\nThe reason The Punisher was and continues to be so popular is because he's essentially an over-the-top version of \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Deathwish\": Frank Castle's family is killed by the mob while on a picnic in Central Park and so he declares war on all criminals wherein he becomes their judge, jury and executioner. Unlike Daredevil, a lawyer who utilizes the justice system, The Punisher just kills 'em all.\r\n\r\nThe first movie version was 1989's \"The Punisher\" with Dolph Lundgren, which was a disappointment. Lundgren was good, but the movie was too Grade B cartoony and it took too many liberties. Still, some consider it a cult flick. The 2004 movie with Thomas Jane curiously transferred the character from New York City to sunny Florida, specifically the Tampa area. There were other oddities that didn\u2019t sit well, but Jane was good as the protagonist and there was enough good in the flick to marginally enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis 2008 rendition, \u201cPunisher: War Zone,\u201d was originally intended to be a sequel to the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane, but delays in the production caused him to pull out. Lexi Alexander ultimately got the gig as director and she pitched the idea of doing the film \u201cas a throwback to '80s era action films\u201d with 6\u20194\u201d Ray Stevenson taking over as The Punisher.\r\n\r\nJigsaw (Dominic West) makes for a memorable villain with Loony Bin Jim an entertaining wacko sidekick (Doug Hutchison). Wayne Knight plays Microchip and Julie Benz the wife of an undercover agent that Castle mistakenly kills on one of his missions. The towering Colin Salmon stands out as a police agent intent on tracking down The Punisher.\r\n\r\nIt was a good call to bring the story back to New York City and, honestly, this has to be one of the best-looking big city movies I\u2019ve ever seen, no kidding. The cinematography/locations/lighting are exceptional. While the movie has the urban grittiness of Nolan\u2019s Batman trilogy, it balances it out with amusing cartoonish-ness. There is some quality drama, like Castle\u2019s anguish over killing a \u201cgood guy\u201d and his dealings with the dead agent\u2019s widow & daughter, but it\u2019s not overlong and dull like in \u201cBatman Begins\u201d (2005) and \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d (2008). Unfortunately, the last act, while serviceable, could\u2019ve been better.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, \u201cPunisher: War Zone\u201d edges out the 2004 movie as the best film version of the character. It\u2019s more faithful to the comics and overall more entertaining even though it totally bombed at the box office.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in Montreal, Quebec.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

It stars John Cusack as a supernatural investigator who rents room 1408 at The Hotel Dolphin in New York. It is said to be a most haunted room and the scene of many deaths. He soon finds his scepticism tested to the max.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has deep themes of grief et al, this essentially boils down to one man in a room being plagued by psychological and physical attacks, with the intended chills and shocks surreal in presentation. It's all very twisty and big on conundrums, which makes a second viewing something of a necessity, whilst Cusack's performance is also reason to check in for another viewing. However, it's not the scary movie some have lauded it as, in fact it's more fun-house palaver than anything terrifying, but there's no doubting the intelligence and skill of the writing. The mind is a curious, wonderful and troubling thing, and 1408 wants us to know it. 6/10"

            "review": "From watching John C. Reilly over the years, in everything from 'Hoffa' and 'Dolores Claiborne' when he was developing his craft, to 'Step Brothers' and 'Carnage', in which he was one of the leading actors that the film was centered on, I really wanted this film to work for me, though I feel in this recent glut of cinema spawned from Hollywood's post-'Twilight' obsession with vampires, that someone really needs to give this trend a coffin rest, at least for a while so creative fires can have a chance to rekindle--it seems to have been done to death. I'm sure this wasn't what Bram Stoker had in mind with his original 'Dracula'. There's nothing in these recent CGI-bloated messes meaty enough to sink one's teeth into. I'm sure Dr. Alucard himself is cursing the day he was granted immortality, if only to avoid his local multiplex, for this very reason.\r\n\r\nLike another recent film I tried to get into, but basically flew off the rails in an enormous video game-like tidal wave of effects I neither wanted nor needed to see ('Your Highness' by David Gordon Green), the filmmakers ill-advisedly thought that the audience had to be captivated by fights and chases galore, but it's like seeing yet another explosion in a Michael Bay movie: Just give me: a) Great presence in an actor, for once, like the Sir Christopher Lees, Sir Peter Cushings, Vincent Prices, Boris Karloffs and Bela Lugosis of yesteryear; b) A story worth telling; and c) A director who knows a thing or two about storytelling--otherwise, I'd rather boycott drinking blood, and simply switch, at least for contemporary film, to a different cup of tea. I'm not surprised whatsoever that this didn't do well at the box office, and that filmmakers decided not to continue with the franchise. Even for vampires, sometimes enough is enough for a lifetime."

The detectives freely admit that they have little experience with this type of case, but the family wants them for two reasons - they're not cops and they know the tough neighborhood in which they all live. As the case progresses, Kenzie and Gennaro face drug dealers, gangs and pedophiles. When they are about to solve the case, they are faced with a moral dilemma that tears them apart.",

It stars Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, John Ashton and Amy Ryan. Music is by Harry Gregson Williams and cinematography by John Toll.\r\n\r\nPrivate Investigators Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Monaghan) are hired to find missing child Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien). It appears to be a simple case of a kidnapping, but the deeper the investigators go the darker the truths become.\r\n\r\nA potent drama, Gone Baby Gone offers up a mystery that is propelled by moral murkiness. Unsurprisingly given it's from a Lehane novel, the twists and deep characterisations dovetail seamlessly with the very real feel of a Boston neighbourhood, the sense of place and community superbly marshalled by Ben Affleck (in what was his debut as a director). The story is so strong it makes us the viewers part of the search for missing Amanda, which in turn forces us to answer the ethical quandaries thrust upon Patrick Kenzie.\r\n\r\nWith tech credits firmly in the plus column and the director un-showy and assured enough to keep the key third act from dragging the picture down, this proves to be very good film making. Pic only has minor faults to be bothered by. Monaghan is a fine actress but she is hard to take here in a street wise role, though with a nicely cast Casey Affleck dominating their scenes she gets away with it. The sharp of mind should pick up on what is driving the mystery forward, whilst the ambiguity at resolution point can go either way for respective viewers appreciation or otherwise. But this is all told a rewarding piece of adult cinema and recommended for sure. 8/10"

Most other reviewers clearly didn't and I respect that, but I genuinely found it alright. It's definitely the weakest entry of the series, yet I still found it entertaining enough.\r\n\r\nMartin Short (Jack Frost) is the star of this second sequel to 1994's <em>'The Santa Clause'</em>, outshining lead Tim Allen; who is still decent, by the way. I love Short's character design, he looks ridiculous in the nicest possible way and Frost (why him, I'm not sure I admit) makes for a relatively good villain. All the other cast members take a backseat, while the storyline of Alan Arkin's Bud is very forgettable and arguably needless.\r\n\r\nI was expecting to dislike this and the preceding follow-up, but to my surprise they are actually - at least to me - harmlessly fun festive films."

Can their relationship handle the stress of him suddenly disappearing without warning and the complications thereof?   \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d (2009) is a drama/romance with a sci-fi element comparable to \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d (2004). Like that film, it can be mind-boggling, but both Bana and McAdams make it worthwhile and there are thought-provoking & moving parts. Eric is masculine and charismatic here, really showing off his talents, while Rachel shines as one of the most uniquely beautiful women to walk the earth. Also check her out in the underrated \u201cThe Lucky Ones\u201d (2008). \r\n\r\nThe ending shows that the real problem in America is old, white, gun-toting Republicans.  (rolling my eyes). Now we\u2019re talking fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in Toronto, Hamilton & Chalk Lake, Ontario, Canada, with establishing shots of Chicago.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"

            "review": "***Denzel Washington tries to deter a terrorist attack upon looking back in time***\r\n\r\nAfter a terrorist explosion of a ferry in New Orleans, an ATF agent (Denzel Washington) joins an experimental FBI surveillance unit that uses space-folding technology to find the culprit and maybe even avert the disaster. While looking in the past he starts to fall for a notable victim of the tragedy (Paula Patton). Val Kilmer plays the head FBI agent and Jim Caviezel the antagonist. Adam Goldberg is on hand as a tech geek.\r\n\r\nWhile watching \"Deja Vu\" (2006) I couldn\u2019t help thinking of \u201cEnemy of the State\u201d (1998) because of the kinetic editing and advanced surveillance technology. Turns out they were made by the same director, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott\u2019s brother, who unfortunately jumped off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2012, ending his life at 68 years-old. (Ridley claimed it was due to his secret struggles with cancer while others say it was due to two antidepressants known to cause suicidal thoughts or paranoid ideation). \r\n\r\n\u201cDeja Vu\u201d is good, especially the compelling last act. Although it may not be as great as \u201cEnemy of the State,\u201d the filmmaking expertise is off the charts, particularly in regards to the depictions of surveillance technology. It\u2019s mind-boggling to think of the effort that was put into making everything gel and dynamically move along without confusing the viewer. However, it admittedly does get a little convoluted in the second act with the experimental observation equipment, which culminates with a thrilling-but-highly-unbelievable past/present car-chase sequence.      \r\n\r\nAnother problem, a minor one, is the revelation of the terrorist, which brings to mind someone like the infamous Timothy McVeigh. Never mind that 99% of the terrorist attacks the world over are by radical Islamists (e.g. 9/11, Orlando, San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Fort Hood, Boston Marathon, Paris, Nice, etc.). Shh, don\u2019t tell anyone.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

The less is more approach has gone, thus there is very little suspense, and in place is a gigantic back story for the killer. The characterisation of the girls, some acted by some very capable actresses, is practically non existent, so very little emotional heft to draw you into a state of caring for them. There's some good gore on show, but since tonally the pic is all over the place, it's never once scary or ironically funny.\r\n\r\nA poor show all round. 3/10"

            "review": "***Americans volunteers become fighter pilots in France during WW1***  \r\n\r\nBefore the USA enters WW1, a young Texas cowboy (James Franco) joins the Lafayette Escadrille in France, a squadron of American fighter pilots. The volunteers are trained and soon experience the glory, anxieties and horrors that go with air combat.  \r\n\r\n\u201cFlyboys\" (2006) was inspired by real events and comes in the tradition of similar WW1 aviation flicks \u201cThe Blue Max\u201d (1966) and \u201cAces High\" (1976). Whilst not great like the exceptional \u201cBlue Max,\u201d the blockbuster-ish \u201cFlyboys\u201d is more compelling than the mundane \u201cAces High,\u201d albeit a little marred by comic book storytelling (think \u201cLegends of the Fall\u201d). It\u2019s also significantly superior to the curiously unabsorbing \u201cThe Red Baron\u201d (2008). \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s ambitious and nigh epic, but there are some contrived, unconvincing moments. For instance, the \u201cGerman spy\u201d part could\u2019ve been cut with no harm done, not to mention make for a more streamlined viewing experience. Yet I\u2019m glad that the film\u2019s not as one-dimensional as the realistic \u201cAces High\u201d (which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is a quality WW1 fighter pilot flick). For instance, \u201cFlyboys\u201d throws in a good trench sequence involving \u2018No Man\u2019s Land\u2019 that LOOKS convincing; too bad it\u2019s not believable at all (the way so-and-so easily saves so-and-so). \r\n\r\nEugene Skinner, the black pilot, was based on the real-life Eugene Jacques Bullard (the filmmakers just changed the surname). In real life Eugene hoped to join the Lafayette Escadrille, but they stopped receiving applicants by the summer of 1916 after accepting 38 American pilots. So, a few months later, Eugene joined the Lafayette Flying Corps on November 15, 1916.\r\n\r\nAs far as strafing downed aviators goes, it was considered dishonorable, but the movie suggests that a minority of ignoble pilots did so, which is reasonable.  In the film an ignoble German pilot strafes & kills an American, which is what later spurs an honorable German pilot to make amends in a pretty powerful scene. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes, and was shot in England (Buckinghamshire, Essex, Bedfordshire & Somerset House, Strand, London, with studio work done in Hertfordshire). PS: The lion, Whisky, was a real mascot for the squad, along with another named Soda.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B+"

It stars Timothy Olyphant, Rhada Mitchell and Joe Anderson. The plot sees a toxic spillage make its way into a small American town's water system and turns some of the locals into marauding maniacs.\r\n\r\nEisner's movie is that rare old thing these days, that of the horror remake that greatly improves upon the original. That might annoy some Romero purists, but the truth is, is that his original film really isn't that great to begin with. Thus it's ripe for a remake, whilst acknowledging that a certain weariness creeps into our thoughts at the seemingly never ending line of horror remakes getting churned out by a Hollywood running out of ideas. Hell I will even venture that we have seen all this before, nothing in this \"Crazies\" will have the horror faithful rushing out to tell their buddies about some overtly cranial splendour piece they have just watched, but this is a very effective horror piece, taut and tense at times, at others sick and splendidly disgusting. Eisner may not be a \"Craven\", or for sure no \"Romero\", but he executes the material with gusto and shows a knack for knowing how to make the material work.\r\n\r\nThe film is structured over three parts. Character formations in the little town of the delightfully small Americana sounding Ogden Marsh, which leads into the infected going doolally. Then it's the army attempting to get things under control. Lastly it's the the fall out as our brave survivors, erm, try to survive and make sense of what is happening. Eisner and his writers even get away with not fleshing out the principal characters. We know Olyphant's Sheriff is a toughie, and that his pregnant wife, Mitchell, is equally resourceful, while the deputy played by the film's standout performer, Joe Anderson, we know is loyal and sharp with a rifle. Who cares about flesh on these bones, let the crazies after them and see how they cope. Where the writers score plus points is with the portrait of a world losing its humanity. The sick are rounded up and contained, nobody cares enough to try and help them, while those sent to restore order, to protect the people, are as dangerous as those bleeding from the eyes and ears. There's madness everywhere.\r\n\r\nWith memorable blood pumping scenes, bona fide suspense and metaphorical smarts in the writing, this is one damn fine remake shocker. 7.5/10"

            "review": "I am the father of Africa.\r\n\r\nBased on Giles Foden's novel of the same name, this filmic version of a period of Idi Amin's presidency of Uganda is a class act - that is if you can accept it as a loose reworking of events in Amin's life? Thus those who filed in for a bona fide history lesson subsequently either got angry or plain disappointed.\r\n\r\nPropelled by Forest Whitaker's barnstorming Oscar winning perf as Amin, Last King of Scotland is riveting and fascinating from first reel to last. The political upheaval at this time in Uganda's history is presented in delicate strokes of dark depressing realisations, and also that of uneasy humour.\r\n\r\nThe portrayal of Amin is most complex, part man child, part greenhorn political suitor and one heartbeat away from despotic lunacy, with Whitaker nailing every single tick. It's key to note that the film does shed some light on Amin, so as a character study it soars and holds you enthral throughout.\r\n\r\nDirector Kevin Macdonald films in kinetic style, which is perfect for the material to hand, and he also deserves a pat on the back for ensuring the characters around Amin (circle of family/advisors etc) are a constant intrigue as per Amin's agenda machinations. James McAvoy gives sterling support as the key \"fish out of water\" doctor who Amin takes to his bosom, while Kerry Washington as Amin's wife number 3 also strikes the right emotive notes.\r\n\r\nThe finale falters somewhat, where it encompasses the Entebbe Hostage Crisis but fails to do that incident justice - instead using it as a cypher to have us rooting for McAvoy's made up character to get out of harm's way. But this is just a misstep that's not film defining. For this is a fine film, if it's not jolting you with harrowing scenes, or tickling your brain for education purpose, then it's demanding your attention for historical noting. Job done. 8.5/10"

            "review": "King George angry at them white fellas. King George say them white fella bad spirit. Must be taken from this land. \r\n\r\nAustralia is directed by Baz Luhrmann and Luhrmann co-writes the screenplay with Stuart Beattie, Ronald Harwood, and Richard Flanagan. It stars Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, Bryan Brown and Brandon Walters.\r\n\r\nIt took a bit of a kicking from the pro critics upon release, where the consensus is that at a cost of $130 million this intended sprawling epic is an ambitious flop. For the record at the box office it practically made double its outlay, so certainly wasn't a financial flop.\r\n\r\nIt's a mixed bag for sure, a film of two differing halves. First half sends Kidman's English aristocrat to Northern Australia after she inherits the sprawling Faraway Downs Ranch. Here she finds herself in the middle of a dirty take over plot and reluctantly makes a working pact with Jackman's stock-man Drover. Seeds are sewn here for a bit of a screwball relationship, all while a cattle feud brews and the Aborigines at the ranch - particularly young Nulllah (Walters) - are in fear of racial tension. Pic then flip-flops into a love story, a war story (as the Japanese attack Darwin) and the bile strewn historical strand that features the \"stolen generations\" of half-white/half-Aboriginal children. \r\n\r\nWith all this going on, as Lurhman nods to classic epics from classic era past, the vistas are stunning and the hard work of cattle ranching is given genuine credence (helps having the rugged Jackman leading the way). Set pieces are exciting, the Japanese aerial attacks realistic for dramatic worth, while the chemistry between the leads, a worthy child performance from Walters and a quality weasel villain turn from Wenham ensure performances don't harm the pic in that department. There's even the likes of Ben Mendelsohn and John Jarratt in secondary support slots. \r\n\r\nIt isn't all it can be, and tonally it feels like there might have been some behind the scenes interference (three co-writers probably didn't help). Yet there are some genuine moments of fun and beauty here, mixed with some heart string tugs and reflection of an historical time that should never ne forgotten. Luhrman reached for \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" and didn't quite make it, but it's honourable and has some damn fine craft for entertainment purpose. 7/10"

            "review": "***Enjoyable mystery/comedy with Scarlett Johansson***  \r\n\r\n\"Scoop\" (2006) is a mystery/dramedy/romance written and directed by Woody Allen. Scarlett Johansson stars as Sondra Pransky, a geeky college journalist vacationing in England. She gets a tip from the ghost of a dead newsman (Ian McShane) on the identity of a local serial killer and proceeds to partner with bumbling magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen); the tip leads them to the rich son of a prominent lord, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), whom Sondra starts to date to acquire information. Is Lyman the notorious killer or isn't he? \r\n\r\nAlthough fantastical and somewhat goofy, \"Scoop\" is first and foremost a mystery and I did enjoy trying to figure out if Peter Lyman is the \"Tarot Card killer.\" In the story we perceive Peter Lyman largely through the lens of Sondra, who is falling for the guy; hence, the viewer warms up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Scoop\" is a comedy but not in the laugh-out-loud sense of, say, \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\"; it's mildly amusing, witty and fun but not knee-slapping funny. So if you're looking for the latter don't bother.\r\n\r\nThe three stars and their chemistry are a highlight. I enjoyed the team-up of Woody (Sid) & Scarlett (Sondra) and their surrogate father/daughter relationship. I knew when I saw \"The Horse Whisperer\" that Scarlett would grow up to be one of cinema's leading beauties, and so she is! Scarlett was 21 while filming \"Scoop\" and the film is worth catching solely for her; just don't expect any raunch or t&a exploitation (although she does have a one-piece bathing suit scene and a nightie sequence, which are rather modest).\r\n\r\nHugh Jackman is a great modern masculine actor, of course, and he does fine here, although I couldn't help wondering if long metal claws would suddenly shoot out of his knuckles! \r\n\r\n\"Scoop\" is an enjoyable mystery/dramedy highlighted by refreshing originality, a quality cast with good chemistry and English locations. I admit that I didn't think I'd like the film during the first 25 minutes or so, but then I caught on to the movie\u2019s vibe. The interactions between the three main characters, their story and the mounting mystery pulled me in and glued me until the end. I also enjoyed the creative zany elements (e.g. crossing the River Styx with the Grim Reaper and the reappearing ghost reporter) and the film's overall refreshing air. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in London & the English countryside.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Divided by their diverse reactions to a nascent ideology, the Steeds struggle to hold together as the strength of their convictions and their filial bonds are tested. The stirring narrative of the faith that led a persecuted people to Missouri and beyond is one of the most poignant untold tales of American history. It is the account of a valiant struggle to exercise the rights promised by a fledgling nation. \"The Work and the Glory: American Zion\" unearths the story of the passion behind the movement which eventually launched the largest American migration and the colonization of the West: the vision of a promised land in America.",

I was really pleased by the comedy caused by the bitchiness, pettiness and downright superficiality of everyone involved, which says SO much about contemporary civilization...and the climax and denouement, are both touching and so fitting. The strong writing and acting made this much better than it had any reason to be."

            "review": "This is a movie that you have to really watch. You cannot sit and divide your time between the movie and reading a book or glancing at your tablet. Doing that would be like watching half a painting. This movie is all about the graphical presentation. Its use of live actors yet with a cartoonish black and white (emphasize on black) look with some occasional splatter of colors is absolutely marvelous. Look down and you miss something. The background voice a\u2019la old fashioned detective story only serves to reinforce the feeling of being dumped into an old cartoon.\r\n\r\nThe story, or rather stories, are cartoon class material as well and not really much to write home about by themselves. They serve well enough to drive this particular movie though. The main actors where fitting right in and making a very enjoyable performance as far as I am concerned. Well, with the possible exception of Bruce Willis who mostly just stood around looking sad but then his role was a rather unrewarding one in the first place. I definitely liked Mickey Rourke as the rather exaggerated tuff guy Marv.\r\n\r\nThis is a violent movie. Like Kill Bill violent if you know what I mean. If this movie would have been made as an ordinary live action movie without the cartoonish elements and the timely switch to silhouette images it would be grossly violent. Again, the cartoonish setting of the movie makes it simply work. Still, the movie is not for the squemish but then, this is the second Sin City movie, it is based on an existing cartoon and Robert Rodriguez had his hand in it so if you are surprised you either went into the wrong show room or should start to do a bit more research before deciding to watch something.\r\n\r\nI did find the fact that the movie actually revolved around two different stories a bit distracting though. A minor complaint but I was really expecting them to somehow get intertwined all through the movie and was a tad disappointed when the second story finished and so did the movie.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that I quite enjoyed this movie. It is really a movie that stands out from the crowd in its use of black and white imagery and cartoon characters. It is black, grim and funny at the same time and for a photography interested person like me the imagery is really beautiful."

Together, they\u2019re called \u201cGrindhouse\u201d because they\u2019re a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in one case, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like \u201cMachete,\u201d are also part of the package.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlanet Terror\u201d involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight \u2019em, led by Freddy Rodr\u00edguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone\u2019s guess).\r\n\r\nThe movie comes across as a melding of \u201cFaster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\u201d (1965), \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d (1968) and \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (1978), but with the modern tone of \u201cSlither\u201d (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind of touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, \u201cPlanet Terror\u201d fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like \u201cFlu Bird Horror\u201d (2008), \u201cWyvern\u201d (2009) and \u201cSasquatch Mountain\u201d (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. GRADE: C\r\n\r\n\u201cDeath Proof\u201d involves an embittered stuntman (Kurt Russell) and his psycho obsession with murdering young women of dubious character with his death proof stunt car (but only the driver\u2019s side). The first half is very good, hindered only by the inane chatter of the girls. This kind of dull drivel goes into overdrive in the second half, particularly involving  Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson, but is rewarded by a thrilling car chase in the country that\u2019s supposedly Tennessee, but obviously Southern Cal.\r\n\r\nRussell\u2019s character is perversely charismatic and the movie perks up whenever he\u2019s on screen. There are no less than eight female co-stars playing mostly classless types (but not all of them) and, depending on your tastes, four of them are quite alluring,: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier (yes, Sidney\u2019s daughter). GRADE: C+/B-\r\n\r\nThe two movies and additional trailers run 3 hours, 11 minutes. Unless you have that kind of time to blow, I suggest watching the movies singularly.\r\n\r\nOVERALL GRADE: C+"
