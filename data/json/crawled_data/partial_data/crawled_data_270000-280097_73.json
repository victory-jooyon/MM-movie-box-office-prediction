Where the all conquering Russian squad were waiting.\r\n\r\nWe follow Brooks as he assembles a youthful squad then pushes them to the limits, mentally and physically, all while facing pressures in his home life as he gives his all on the ice rinks. If you know your sports history then there's obviously no surprise factor here, but there's good insight into squad dynamics, of coaching and toughness involved in the many facets of high level sport. Russell leads his young cast admirably, while the action scenes during the matches have a kinetic energy that's most impressive. 7/10"

Ocean's Twelve is a waste, a film coasting on star appeal, a picture desperately trying to cram as much into its screenplay for fear of failing.\r\n\r\nThe plot shoots off in a number of directions, yet incredibly it still wastes most of the cast who have all been held over from Ocean's 11. This time Catherine Zeta-Jones joins in for some weighty dressage and Vincent Cassel is along as some sort of break-dancing Raffles dude. There's the odd in-joke that works, while the by-ply between the principal players (Clooney/Pitt/Damon) holds a modicum of entertainment value. However, once the dust settles on the myriad of schemes and scrapes, you are left with a sequel of a remake that is almost everything the other film was not. Boo. 4/10"

That is to provide an hour and a half of decent entertainment.\r\n\r\nOur hero comes back from being away for quite a while and finds the bad guys are in control. A pretty classical story which have been used since the first movies were made (and even before that). The movie can easily be said to be a modern day Western movie as far as the story goes.\r\n\r\nOur hero, Dwayne Johnson, is doing a decent job of being a hero. The actions scenes, which is really why you are watching this movie after all, are reasonably well done. Of course they are more of TV-movie quality than anything else but good enough in the context of this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie plays out more or less exactly as you would expect. Hero comes home, find bad guys in control, gets into shuffle with bad guys, bad guys tries to take on hero via family and friends, fails, hero goes after main bad guy in a long chase/fight, happy ending, roll after texts. As I wrote, it could just as well have been an old Western movie. The traditional western saloon is replaced by a casino and the whisky and cattle is replaced with crooked gambling and some modern drug dealing.\r\n\r\nThe one part I though was silly, as in bad silly, was the trial in the first half of the movie. Warning, spoiler ahead! I mean, come on. Hero demolishes Casino and gets put on trial, hero shows jury his scars and asks to get a non-guilty verdict, jury happily obliges him. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nApart from this the movie completed its mission of knocking and hour and a half off my life while keeping me from being bored in front of the TV."

John Robinson plays Stacy, Emile Hirsch plays Jay and Victor Rasuk plays Tony (aka T.A.). Heath Ledger is on hand as Skip Zephyr while Rebecca De Mornay appears as one of the teens\u2019 struggling mother.\r\n\r\nWhile I suppose \u201cLords of Dogtown\u201d (2005) is a sports flick, it\u2019s just as much a coming-of-age movie detailing growing-up on the bad side of Venice, aka Dogtown, the birthplace of America\u2019s skateboard culture, which influenced the world.\r\n\r\nIt reminded me of the dissolute environment depicted in \u201cRiver\u2019s Edge\u201d (1986) with elements of Jim Morrison\u2019s hedonistic misadventures from \u201cThe Doors\u201d (1991), but combined with skateboard action, like skating in dry backyard pools and various competitions. It\u2019s a good movie with slightly amped-up events (so what else is new?), but somewhat hampered by a curiously dismal air with occasional dialogues that don\u2019t work. Maybe I found it slightly depressing because it reminded me of the glory & shame of my teen years. The 70\u2019s soundtrack is great, however.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, including Venice Beach, Imperial Beach and Santa Monica. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

            "review": "Love vs. cold analytical thought\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2004 and directed by Joseph Ruben, \"The Forgotten\" relays the story of Telly (Julianne Moore), a mother who discovers all traces of her deceased 9 year-old son have been erased, including photos, videos, documents and the memories of other people. Her psychologist (Gary Sinise) and husband tell her she's delusional, but she KNOWS otherwise. Thus begins a thrilling search for the truth wherein she teams-up with Ash (Dominic West) and tangles with NSA agents and more.\r\n\r\nThe reviews to \u201cThe Forgotten\u201d couldn't be more opposite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since some of the best artistic items polarize opinion. The film admittedly has weaknesses and those who don\u2019t like it zero-in on these flaws.\r\n\r\nIn style, it is similar to \"The Mothman Prophesies\" (2002), but not as good, intricate or artistic. There are similarities to The X-Files with the two protagonists, one being a female redhead, searching for the truth in what is essentially a sci-fi/mystery tale with the government somehow being involved.\r\n\r\nBecause of the highly mixed reviews I was watching the first 15 minutes only half-attentive, but when Telly (Moore) confronts Ash (West) and subsequently teams-up with him my attention perked up. Ash is an ex-NHL player who's given up on life and turned to alcohol to drown out his sorrows. What tragic event happened that would cause him to throw in the towel and turn to the bottle? I'll leave that to you to discover.\r\n\r\nAnyway, remember the great masculine actors of the past, like Charlton Heston, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and perhaps even Marlon Brando? There was just something about them that set \u2019em apart and made you take notice when they were on screen. Dominic West is such an actor. He's reminiscent of James Remar, whom you might remember as Ajax in \"The Warriors\" (1979).\r\n\r\nThe subplot of Ash's drunkenness struck a chord with me because I know people, incredibly talented people like Ash, who've essentially given up and given in to alcohol, wasting their lives away. Not to mention the fact that I've been seriously tempted to give up as well at times (albeit not to alcohol). I can relate and I'm sure you can too.\r\n\r\nAs noted, the film is a sci-fi/mystery tale and therefore the explanation (no spoilers) is rather outlandish, but not necessarily unbelievable. \"Flightplan\" (2005) was a similarly-themed film; although its explanation was not outlandish, just totally unbelievable. So if you can't handle outlandishness I suggest you forget \"The Forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Forgotten\" is essentially a story of love v.s. cold analytical thought. Personally I fall right in the middle between these two dynamics. This conflict is what made the character of Spock so fascinating. Remember the Star Trek episode \"This Side of Paradise\" where he was able to walk free of his strict adherence to logic and experience the warmth & joy of love for the first time? At the end of the episode he sadly states that it was the first time in his life that he was truly happy.\r\n\r\n\"The Forgotten\" is a story of tortuous struggle and potential triumph, for both Telly and Ash. Although logic is important, love is more powerful. Not to mention warmer and life-inducing.\r\n\r\nThe film is short and sweet at a mere 1 hour and 26 minutes before credits. The DVD features an extended cut with an alternative ending wherein the possible conspiracy is less malevolent. Watch the theatrical cut first and then simply go to the deleted scenes section and watch the two deleted scenes and the alternate ending (unless you want to watch the ENTIRE film twice, that is; it's just not necessary). I'll say this: the kissing scene should have never been omitted. It works. But perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to paint Telly as a potential adulterer, which isn't a bad thing.\r\n\r\nDon't listen to the grumps who didn't 'get' \"The Forgotten.\" The reason they didn't 'get' it is because their pendulum veers too heavily toward cold logic, but they don't have to stay that way. :)\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in the New York City area.

            "review": "Mr. & Mrs. Smith explodes with flaming chemistry but assassinated its own script. \u201cBrangelina\u201d. Without Liman\u2019s standard action comedy, we wouldn\u2019t have had the power couple that dominated the tabloids. Several children wouldn\u2019t have been adopted and brought up in a completely different, yet financially stable, environment. Jolie wouldn\u2019t have been the charitable humanitarian she is now. And Shiloh\u2019s first baby photograph wouldn\u2019t have amassed over ten million dollars worldwide. Wow! Suffice to say, the two most beautiful humans in Hollywood have a substantial amount of gratitude to show Liman for his efforts in pairing them. If only his energetic vibrancy was enough to power the lacklustre screenplay, the balance of action and comedy could\u2019ve been a landmark within the sub-genre. A bored upper middle class married couple are astonished to learn that they work for differing assassination organisations, soon to be assigned to kill each other.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s your standard marriage. Winning a teddy bear at a carnival, falling in love whilst buying the most expensive mansion on the street, succumbing to the same mundane daily routine, destroying the house with an almighty shootout followed by a gas explosion, participating in the feistiest erotic love-making scene ever and naturally ending in marriage counselling. A cruel irony for \u201cBrangelina\u201d, maybe they should\u2019ve watched the film they made together? Cynicism aside, what truly elevates the memorability of this feature is the onscreen (and offscreen, bow chicka wow wow...) chemistry of its leading stars. Jolie and Pitt are exceptionally effortless with their comedic timing, dramatic endeavours and high-octane action. The lightning-fast wit that they inject into Kinberg\u2019s less than impressive script is nothing short of, well, impressive. They make the film. They are the film. And they certainly have solid taste in curtains.\r\n\r\nLiman maintains a light tone throughout, never dabbling into the cracks of the marriage which is vital for retaining a fun buoyancy. This isn\u2019t an analysis on marital breakdown. It\u2019s just a tongue in cheek slice of entertainment.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, despite the tantalising chemistry of its leads, you never quite feel that they are truly in love. Unfortunately, Kinberg\u2019s script is so vacuous in emotional conviction, that both Smiths resemble roommates than a married couple. Understandably the marriage is stale as they conform to their upper middle class lifestyle, but even when they fight and makeup, there\u2019s no real connection. I yearn to see Jolie and Pitt lust over each other. The momentum essentially grinds to a halt after their house explodes, with Kinberg\u2019s script focussing on a central plot point involving \u201cThe Tank\u201d and an onslaught of heavily armed operatives raiding a department store. Attention for the splendid couple instantly dissipated with a third act that seemingly refused to end, ultimately losing the acute fun that preceded the underwhelming conclusion. The whole \u201ckeeping up appearances\u201d act was tossed out of the smashed window, and that was the sole element that made the film incredibly fun.\r\n\r\nMr. & Mrs. Smith doesn\u2019t conclude with a divorce, as it is sensible light entertainment for the vast majority of its runtime, yet the concluding act and poor screenplay prevent the marriage from flourishing fully. Angelina Jolie man! I would abandon my homosexuality for her..."

As such it has some mighty good movies to live up to and that it doesn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nThis time David S Goyer took to both write and direct the movie. I guess he should have stuck to script writing or something. The action scenes are not too bad. However, that\u2019s all there is. Just a string of actions scenes barely strung together.\r\n\r\nThe worst offence of them all is Dracula. When I first learned that they brought in Dracula as the chief nemesis I thought that sounded cool. Wrong! Apart from a fairly cool look when he get really pissed off the film\u2019s portrayal of Dracula is a joke. It\u2019s an insult to the Dracula legends.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, it\u2019s 2 hours of not too bad action but a disappointment as a Blade movie."

            "review": "They just couldn't leave him on his island could they...\r\n\r\nKing Kong is directed by Peter Jackson and Jackson co-writes the screenplay with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It's based on a story by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace. It stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Evan Parke, Jamie Bell and Kyle Chandler. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Andrew Lesnie.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the hugely successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson turned his attentions to a reimaging of that daddy of classic creature features, King Kong. With all the new tools of the trade to hand, Jackson set about making a Kong film full of love and respect the original from 1933, whilst obviously making his own beast as it were. Story remains the same, mankind sets off to a fabled place known as Skull Island, there they find beasties not of this world, not least a gigantic mountain of a gorilla. They stupidly bring him back to America for money making exercises and things go really bad. The End.\r\n\r\nI have personally found it most interesting re-watching the film nearly 15 years since its release, especially given we have not long had a different Kong reboot with \"Kong: Skull Island\" in 2017. For the differences, for better or worse depending on your proclivities in Kongdom, are enormous. Kong: Skull Island is a no brain adventure yarn, high on action but low on intelligence, but it does know it. Jackson's Kong aspired to be much more cerebral, and for the most part it achieves it. Sadly it takes a whopping 3 hours to reveal its intentions, which was a problem to many back in 2005, and is still a hindrance sitting down to watch it these days - this even knowing and preparing once again for how long it is. Frustratingly there's a great film in the mix just crying out for an hour of extraneous filler and clunky dialogue to be jettisoned. \r\n\r\nOnce set up has been achieved in the first hour, we finally get to Skull Island and it's an absolute technical treat. The look is fantastic, the turn of events as Kong and his acolytes have been introduced is terrific. From here it's creature feature mayhem, the beauty and the beast aspect kicks into gear, and it's all very comforting, thrilling even - with one exception. A dinosaur stampede looks ridiculous, the blend of human actors and CGI is so poor it belies the money spent on the effects for this production. That aside, though, the action sequences are electric, particularly the monster mash ups. Yet the quite reflective periods on Skull Island really strike a chord as well, just sections where Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) are chilling out together, taking in the landscape that money mad men want to take Kong away from...\r\n\r\nThen it's back to The States and carnage ensues, culminating in a brilliantly staged last quarter of film, where all that superb period detail gets obliterated during the battle between man and beast, and where even now I'm rooting for Kong to win! As the tenderness of the Beauty and the Beast arc subsides - and it is beautiful - it's then that you once again know that Jackson was too indulgent. His cast were on form, Serkis as Kong a revelation, this is a great picture at times, a real treat in High Definition, if only someone had fronted him up to not over indulge. For then we might have a 9/10 movie as opposed to a bloated 7/10 one."

I'm gonna count it.\r\n\r\n<em>'Valiant'</em> is a little hit-and-miss, however I think it just about makes for good viewing. The animation is, honestly, kinda crappy, though there are moments where it does look more than decent.\r\n\r\nThe plot is mostly predictable but I do actually quite like it, as it tells a story about war pigeons from WWII. It is amusing for the majority, even if the characters are strangely overtly horny too much.\r\n\r\nThe strongest part of this film is easily the cast, who are very good. Ricky Gervais (Bugsy) is the best voice on show, he is the ideal actor to play that role. There are many other familiar voices: Ewan McGregor (Valiant), John Cleese (Mercury), Jim Broadbent (Monty), Hugh Laurie (Gutsy) and Tim Curry (Von Talon); as well as one or two others. McGregor is largely positive, even if he does get a tad too sappy in parts.\r\n\r\nI can see why this splits opinion, I truly can. However, it entertained me just enough and it isn't one I mind rewatching to be frank."

Lindsey Lohan has some competent cast to share the load in this, particularly Alison Pill (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Cooties), an under rated actress, and Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body) playing the Rachel McAdams (Meangirls) of the movie.\r\n\r\nI understand that location shooting can get expensive, but the movie looks over all well produced, and while the premise is rather annoying, the writing looks fairly solid, if character driven:  not a bad thing, but it usually makes for more interesting tidbits as opposed to an epic a plot line, which was....different depending upon what angle you take.\r\n\r\nThere are good technical things, great character things, and decent story things here: it's not a bad movie, it's just not one I'm going to tell you to go see over so many other titles."

            "review": "Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Inglourious Basterds\" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless \u201cJew Hunter\u201d Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies except \u201cDeath Proof\u201d (2007). The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning M\u00e9lanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Br\u00fchl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino\u2019s other great movies (\u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201cJackie Brown\u201d), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they\u2019re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer\u2019s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it\u2019s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

I\u2019ve now fixed that and it\u2019s time to talk about it. Let\u2019s start with the official description:\r\n\r\n_Victor Navorski is a man without a country; his plane took off just as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat exploded in his homeland, leaving it in a shambles, and now he\u2019s stranded at Kennedy Airport, where he\u2019s holding a passport that nobody recognises. While quarantined in the transit lounge until authorities can figure out what to do with him, Viktor simply goes on living - and courts romance with a beautiful flight attendant. _\r\n\r\nA man stuck in an airport for months on end, sounds a little far fetched? Not so much - this was actually inspired by the true story of a man named Merhan Nasseri who lived at Charles DeGaulle Airport in France from August 1988 to August 2006, yes, 18 years. He got stuck when his refugee certification documents were stolen from him in France, en route from Belgium to England. It\u2019s an incredible story, and worth reading up on on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty light and fluffy stuff, and Hanks is well cast as the curious and friendly Navorski. He makes the most of his situation and quickly adapts to his circumstances, and makes a number of friends with various airport staff. He also makes an enemy in the character played by Stanley Tucci, the Customs Director at the airport. \r\n\r\nWhile at times it felt a bit like _Product Placement: The Movie_, it\u2019s a charming movie that despite a few unrealistic - things like his rapid progress in a English - takes you along for a good fun ride. Hanks is great, his friends are a suitably quirky bunch, and Tucci plays the bad guy really well too. Catherine Zeta-Jones is in this too, but seems a little shoehorned in. There\u2019s enough to work with with the \u201cstuck in the airport\u201d situation and didn\u2019t really need a romantic plot line, but I guess these are the things that get done to make it appeal to a wider audience. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just been removed from the Netflix catalogue here in Australia - which was the reason I finally watched it - but if you happen to come across it, it\u2019s a really nice film that will warm your heart for a couple of hours."

Marmite is a food substance that people either love or hate, The Box is a Marmite movie. \r\n\r\nCameron Diaz and James Marsden star as a couple who are visited by a mysterious stranger (Frank Langella) who has a bizarre offer. The Box now in the couple's possession has a button (Langella's mysterious Arlington Steward informs them it's called the Button Unit), they are told that if they push the button then a complete stranger will die, they will then receive a life changing amount of money. What to do?. \r\n\r\nBased on a Richard Matheson short story titled \"Button, Button\", The Box is an ethereal mind meld of a piece. Morals and ethics are married up to a whole bunch of twists and other worldly ideas, which goes some way to explaining that where once there was a more than adequate half hour \"Twilight Zone\" episode (Profile in Silver/Button, Button 1986), there is now a near two hour movie crammed to the brim. It's this that hurts an otherwise stylishly produced and potentially thoughtful picture. \r\n\r\nAfter the raves and craves for his \"Donnie Darko (2001)\", Richard Kelly appeared to believe the press praise, that here was a new surreal director on the block. Where \"M. Night Shyamalan\" had success with the twist gimmick and couldn't let it go until his career went in the swamp, so to Kelly who kept straining to make movies that were needlessly over complex, trying to be smart when it isn't needed (\"Southland Tales (2006)\" is a car wreck of a movie). The Box does have intelligence and lots of good ideas, but a two hour film it does not make, with the attempts at weaving all the threads together proving to be too problematic come the finale. Incredulity a most appropriate word, plausibility is not. \r\n\r\nThe Box, an intriguing - attractive - failure, but some do and will love it. If you haven't seen it then roll the dice and good luck. 6/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: We have yet to actually get an adaptation to screen that contains Matheson's original literary ending!"

You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.\r\n\r\nGeorge Romero fans feared the worst, another one of his sacred original zombie trilogy films was being remade, this even though the remake of Night of the Living Dead didn't disgrace itself. As it happened, the fears were unfounded, for Zack Snyder and his team crafted one of the best horror remakes going.\r\n\r\nThe premise follows Romero's wonderful version, a mysterious epidemic is causing the populace to turn into undead zombies, the bite of which transfers the illness to another. A small group of survivors make it to the Crossroads Mall and hole up there whilst trying to keep at bay the zombie hordes, but inner fighting threatens the group whilst they know they can't stay there for ever.\r\n\r\nRight from the off the film grabs you around the throat, it's a blistering and terrifying opening which brings heartbreak and terror in equal measure. It also announces to us that these zombies are different to Romero's, these suckers can run, and run fast. After some chaos and blood, the introductions to our survivors is set up and the pic settles into a superb group dynamic situation, where machismo and brains meet dumb and dumber, all while little devilish moments trickle away in the background.\r\n\r\nIt's the focus on the survivors that really lifts it to greater heights, how they variously react to their plight, there's good thought gone into the screenplay (James Gunn). The natural progression of this type of film calls for horror moments, and Snyder deftly slots them in when the pic needs them, which again brings about scenes of terror and genuine heartbreaking moments. Some neat cameos will be cheered by fans of Romero's work, while the cast are superb here, with Sarah Polley the standout fulfilling the believable promise of the character as written.\r\n\r\nA remake that is its own beast yet still pays homage to what inspired it, and good at both! Now that's a rare thing in horror! 8/10"

There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.\r\n\r\nIt has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.\r\n\r\nI've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. They'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure."

Yet it's a bit of a one trick pony and difficult to take seriously, while it's also surprisingly bloodless, negating the interest of the potential Stephen King blood-lust crowd. The reveal is something of a cheat given what has gone before, belief of suspension is so stretched to breaking point, you literally should be wondering just what all other characters were doing in the film?!\r\n\r\nStill, Johnny and John, resplendent with weird hats and hairdo's, give good camera time and save David Koepp's movie from stinker damnation. 6/10"
