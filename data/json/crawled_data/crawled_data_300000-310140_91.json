That's thanks to some lazy writing and humour, none of the jokes land while the plot - while I praise them for changing up the original - is so lame - their thinking seemingly just stopped at 'man acts like dog' and thought that'll do.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that hampers the film is the attempt at a heartwarming story with the main family, which is nauseating to see unfold. There's also a scene at the end where the dad (Allen) is stark naked in public and in front of his children, who have literally zero reaction and just stand there smiling ...\r\n\r\nWith that noted, I will say I didn't hate watching this. Tim Allen, whilst over-the-top and in your face at times, is a good cast to play this silly role - he stops the character of Dave becoming annoying, he's just cringey to me.\r\n\r\nThe casting is, actually, pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. and Danny Glover are involved, as are recognisable faces Spencer Breslin, Shawn Pyfrom, Philip Baker Hall and Joel David Moore. Rhea Seehorn, star of <em>'Better Call Saul'</em>, also appears - you could make a case that this is a prequel to BCS ...\r\n\r\nI have no idea why they decided to remake this, especially given they seemingly didn't put any serious effort into it. It's weird, cringe, dull and entirely forgettable. A poor film."

Tykwer, with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil, also composed the music. The screenplay by Tykwer, Andrew Birkin, and Bernd Eichinger is based on Patrick S\u00fcskind's 1985 novel Perfume. Set in 18th century France, the film tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Whishaw), an olfactory genius, and his homicidal quest for the perfect scent.\r\n\r\nBasically, I can say that this movie isn't for the emotional ones. It is a gently reminder that the perfection doesn't have to be shown or made in the real life. It should stay on a shelf and don't be touched by anyone. "

If you take out the main parts of this, you'll hold some good stuff - the message, the twist, the means are just some of them. Sadly, everything that surrounds the positive things set it back.\r\n\r\nThe cast aren't great either. It's cool to see a Disney film, especially from this era and before, give new voices a chance; rather than giving roles to the usual suspects. Unfortunately, none of this cast are memorable - at least to me. Matthew Josten has one or two funny bits as Goob, they could've done more with him.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's largely fine, though a few moments haven't aged incredibly. The end song from Rob Thomas is nice. All in all, however, this isn't a film I can honestly say I enjoyed. I wouldn't be opposed to a remake, if they ironed the execution out."

Kim Cattrall, Hayden Panettiere and the other skaters all embody the insanity of the ice skating culture and establish the world that Michelle Tratchenburg and Joan Cusack's characters are forced to deal with.\r\n\r\nIn the end it becomes a story of passions (clearly stated in the movie) and really feels uplifting and inspiring despite the absurdity of the situations.\r\n\r\nI know that when I throw this on, I'm going to enjoy a movie."

            "review": "Engrossing and imaginative modern Mystery/Horror with Elisha Cuthbert \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2005 and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, \"House of Wax\" is a horror/slasher about six college students (4 dudes and 2 gals) who drive from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend a crucial football game. They end up camping in the woods somewhere off I-10 where some of the party discovers a mysterious town in the sticks that has a curious House of Wax. Horror and death ensue.\r\n\r\nThis is not a remake of the splendid 1953 Vincent Price cult flick of the same name. The only thing these two films have in common is their title, their genre, and the fact that they both involve a wax museum. It's therefore pointless to compare them as they are two totally different stories. Plot-wise, \"House of Wax\" is an obvious mixture of the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974) and the 1953 film of the same name, along with elements of more modern flicks like \u201cWrong Turn\u201d (2003) and torture porn.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first 12 minutes or so are unimpressive with too much annoying shaky cam, the story starts to capture your attention at the camp-out sequence. From there their encounter with a horrible stench, a local hick, and the mystery of the isolated town & wax museum gradually pulls you in. The fairly slow initial 50-minutes are a crucial character-building and mystery-developing foundation to the final horrific hour.\r\n\r\nThe major protagonist of the story is Carly, played by Elisha Cuthbert, who was only 22 during filming and never looked better with her curvy cuteness. The glamorous and infamous Paris Hilton also stars and does a commendable job, but Elisha basically blows her out of the water as far as all-around beauty goes.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ms. Hilton, in light of the ads to \u201cCome see Paris Hilton die,\u201d it\u2019s no secret that her character does indeed buy the farm and, the way it happens, is pretty amusing. The film's worth checking out for this scene alone, especially if you despise her.\r\n\r\nThe picture was shot in Queensland, Australia, of all places, but it works alright as a stand-in for the Deep South, although I don\u2019t recall any hills along I-10, as depicted in the background of the town. Speaking of the town, it doesn\u2019t look like a Deep South town, but rather a contrived set. Nevertheless, the filmmaking is top-notch in all categories with the rest of the no-name cast doing a fine job. As a matter of fact, the six college kids are all rather likable; even Nick (Chad Michael Murray), Carly\u2019s supposedly 'black sheep' twin, once he shows his true colors.\r\n\r\n\"House of Wax\" works fabulously for what it IS, a mystery/slasher flick. The unlikely story is played straight and serious by all involved; there's no silly \"comedic relief\" or camp to be seen. Everyone knows going in that this isn't going to be \"Gandhi.\" But if you're in the mood for an entertaining and imaginative mystery/horror picture, look no further. \"House of Wax\" has practically everything you\u2019d want in such a film. Why do I describe it as imaginative? See the conclusion's spectacular melting wax museum and you'll understand; this is F/X at its finest.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes. WRITERS: Chad Hayes & Carey W. Hayes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

His wife seems to be hiding something, however (Gena Rowlands). Peter Sarsgaard is on hand as the estate\u2019s amiable lawyer.  \r\n\r\n\"The Skeleton Key\" (2005) is a Southern Gothic supernatural thriller set in the Louisiana bayou \u00e0 la \u201cCat People\u201d (1982) and \u201cThe Reaping\u201d (2007). It\u2019s not as good as the former, but arguably superior to the latter or at least on par. Most of the film is an eerie drama taking place in and around the old Southern mansion, but the pace picks up in the final act with a quality surprise climax. Neither my wife nor I were able to anticipate the revelation, but it makes sense and hails back to earlier obscure horror flicks which I can\u2019t name because I don\u2019t want to give it away.\r\n\r\nKate is a highlight with her cute face and the director doesn\u2019t fail to capture her beauty in a tasteful way, but she needed to gain about 12 lbs as her thinness is un-alluring. Really, the only negatory is that the setting/cast is one-dimensional, which makes the movie tediously mundane, but this is offset by the creepy supernatural element.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in Louisiana (Felicity Plantation, Vacherie; Bayou Gauche & New Orleans) with additional stage stuff done in Universal City, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

With that noted, <em>'Eight Below'</em> - a remake of 1983's <em>'Antarctica'</em> - is still a fairly decent survival drama.\r\n\r\nThe cast certainly elevate my feelings towards the film, with Paul Walker impressing in the lead role; it comes across as if he actually does have a bond with the dogs, which is obviously key.\r\n\r\nIt's very much Walker's show, but Bruce Greenwood, Jason Biggs and Moon Bloodgood all add small but welcomed things with their characters. The dogs themselves are great and do a lot of good work onscreen, a load of which being pretty believable.\r\n\r\nThere are saddening parts to it, for sure, but overall I wanted a more deeper ride with this premise than what I got, but there's definitely reasons to watch it."

On paper, the premise can look a bit ridiculous, don't get me wrong it is, but the film manages to not only make it entertaining but to also make it both amusing and heartwarming.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes are superbly done, when the cat (dog?) gets let out the bag, so to speak, it does take a few moments to regain its footing but quickly turns into a lot of fun. It's got a pleasing adventure, heartfelt feelings and comedy to keep it fresh.\r\n\r\nThe cast are very good, too. John Travolta (Bolt) and Miley Cyrus (Penny) do very fine jobs in their respective roles, but it's actually Susie Essman who stands out most to me - she gives a super performance as Mittens. A few of the other voices do solid stuff, also.\r\n\r\nThoroughly enjoyed this."

Also starring are Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell and William Fitchner.\r\n\r\nOne time gridiron superstar Paul Crewe, now disgraced, gets himself sent to a prison run by a gridiron fanatical warden. Coerced into being part of a match between the guards and the cons, Crewe has his work cut out to make a team out of misfits, runts and near idiots!\r\n\r\nAdam Sandler has always proved divisive, and this film has proved to be no exception. Massively popular at the box office (over $100 million profit), it's a film that anyone with an aversion to Sandler should stay away from. I mean if by 2005 you hadn't realised he's not for you then why would you watch this?\r\n\r\nComing from someone who absolutely adores the original film, I had no hesitation in watching this, I like Sandler and I don't mind remakes as I'm always intrigued to see how they pan out. This is full of prison stereotypes, close to the knuckle humour and meaty violence, but is it funny? From my perspective yes it is, very much so, with some of the dialogue sparkling and delivered with comedic grace by a fine cast. But that's me, others, as we know, don't feel the same. \r\n\r\nThe action is well put together by Segal, the convicts training sequences are great fun, while the main game that crowns the pic is exciting, dramatic and yes, great fun. The support slots contain more beef than an Aberdeen Angus stew, with the likes of Michael Irvin, Terry Crews, Steve Austin and Brian Bosworth fronting up, while David Patrick Kelly playing a weasel is never a bad thing. A lot of people loved it in 2005, I'm now one of their number. 7/10"

Man mountain Marv is out to avenge a murdered hooker, Dwight attempts to help the red light girls stay independent from the mob, and aging cop Hartigan is trying to protect a beautiful dancer from a sadistic pervert.\r\n\r\nI think the first thing I should say is that I have no frame of reference as regards the adaptation here, I have never read (or seen) a Frank Miller story, but from what I can gather from the IMDb site is that fans of Miller's graphic stories were well pleased with the final result. I'm pleased to see that, because too many times comic book adaptations are roundly panned by the hard core fan base of each respective franchise for not being close to the spirit of the source, so here I'm doubly relieved mainly because I find Sin City to be a majestic assault on the senses.\r\n\r\nSin City is a stark place, full of seedy residents thriving on misery and mistrust, and here we are privy to three stories that only serve to remind us that we don't want to be anywhere near the place. Playing out as some sort of horror comic noir, Sin City is for sure a very violent picture, yet the violence is formed so perfectly in its style, it cloaks the film in artistic class. Once viewed, Sin City is never forgotten, and I for one literally do tip my hat towards Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez for bringing such a great and interesting movie to the masses. All of the cast do great work, so I'll not single anyone out for praise, the techniques and the whole structure of the piece is quite simply marvellous, and as for the writing? Well get a load of it!\r\n\r\nSin City, a dark horrible place, Sin City, a wonderful wonderful movie. 9/10"

Through the dark power of witchcraft, however, she returns as a wannabe seductress to enact revenge. Matthew Marsden and Claudette Mink play a married teacher and administrator at the school. \r\n \r\n\u201cTarmara\u201d contains elements of \u201cCarrie\u201d (1976), \u201cThe Rage: Carrie 2\u201d (1998), \u201cThe House on Sorority Row\u201d (1983) (which was remade as \u201cSorority Row\u201d in 2009), \u201cThe Craft\u201d (1996) and \u201cThe Faculty\u201d (1998). Yet it mixes its own brew and, surprisingly, has a few original aspects, along with respectable gore, if that\u2019s your thang. The movie influenced future flicks like \u201cI\u2019ll Always Know what you did Last Summer\u201d (2006) and, especially, \u201cJennifer\u2019s Body\u201d (2009). If you like these kinds of films, you\u2019ll like this one.\r\n\r\nThere are some awkward or un-compelling moments in the filmmaking. With just a few key tweaks this could\u2019ve been great in the manner of \u201cThe Rage: Carrie 2.\u201d Still, it\u2019s good enough and, like I said, has some innovative parts. Marsden and Mink are strong as the adult protagonists. The women are cute (e.g. Katie Stuart as winsome Chloe) but, with the exception of Mink, they look like they\u2019re suffering mild anorexia. Please, ladies, eat some food!                   \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Winnipeg, Manitoba. WRITER: Jeffrey Reddick. \r\n \r\nGRADE: B/B-"

Just what caused the feud between the vampires and the lycans?\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly reviews for this sequel are mixed, it's either a smart action popcorner that was warranted, or it's a huge let down after the first film. Personally I'm in the first camp, personally because it does pretty much the same things, only the story has a bit of complexity about it to try and bluff us that it's cerebral.\r\n\r\nFor a film about vampires and werewolves at war it delivers all that is required in the modern era. There's lots of high energy action, blood and guts galore, CGI overdrive, fast pacing and a sexy lead actress fronting the piece. The story ticks along nicely, introducing new and interesting characters, while flashbacks fill in the gaps for any newcomers to the series. The main villain is one bad-ass winged mofo, a genuine terror that our protagonists have right to fear, and the finale is as expected a bonkers array of bloody chaos.\r\n\r\nSmartly put together by director Len Wiseman and coolly photographed by Simon Duggan (steel blues and greys), it isn't ground breaking cinema, but it's a wail of a time for those with expectation levels set at popcorn bonanza. 7/10"

In theory at least.  The film plods along with characters announcing what they see in front of them, almost like they are performing an audio play.  Most of the film is all tell and no show, which is a mistake for the medium it is delivered in.\r\n\r\nThe B grade cast take what they are doing very seriously, and most of them are trying to do the best with the material they have.  Sadly the script is weak, there is almost zero character development and people are constantly behaving irrationally.  I know it's an action/horror, and no one ever acts normally in those films, but to have experienced salvage divers panicking so quickly when things go south is stupid and unrealistic.\r\n\r\nSome of the design for the creatures are interesting and kinda cool, with surprisingly adequate CG for a B movie, and they are what elevates it from complete garbage to just not very good.  Unfortunately most of the action scenes are edited at such a frenetic pace that you almost have no idea what is happening.\r\n\r\nCould have been worse, but probably should have been better than it was, maybe would have been better with a more seasoned director.  The biggest fault lies with the weak script though, so maybe it was always destined to be what it is.\r\n\r\nMaybe 5/10 is a little generous, but 4 seems too harsh, so there you have it."

The film is really split into two halves here with this one being basically helped greatly by its really good possession and shock scenes. The opening scene that sets her up to becoming possessed is one of it's best sequences, as the long hallway and the unearthly voices floating around give it an unearthly feel while the first scene in the classroom where she sees a demonic face appearing in the window through a cloud of mist and turns around to see a student's face turn into a distorted demon's face giving off an unearthly roar makes it quite shocking. Running out into the rain and seeing more demonic faces give off the same unearthly roar is a bit clich\u00e9d, but it still helps to sell the mood while the finale in the church giving this a quite creepy conclusion. The different manners of how she\u2019s become afflicted are quite memorable moments with the frenzied bug-eating, speaking in tongues or just contorting her body into such impossible positions that it really becomes obvious something is wrong with her, and the long, suspenseful and chilling exorcism is the film's selling point, coming off with any number of creepy ideas and scenes in such a drawn-out style is one of the best scenes in the film. Otherwise, beyond the shocks and the exorcism, there isn't much else to like about it. Therefore, everything else in it doesn't really work which is only relegated to the courtroom battle drama. It's marketed as being a supernatural possession film, and the best moments come from those scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film is a courtroom battle with the supernatural elements coming in the form of flashbacks is a real misstep and is likely to confuse those coming in expecting the other kind of film. It's not that they're boring or anything, it's just that it's out of nowhere that it becomes that way, and it can be a disappointment. The fact that these are slow and really long don't help matters, extending this out far longer than it should. This could've easily been an hour and a half, or maybe a little longer, but the two hours running time forces it to keep the courtroom antics going for no reason other than to extend the running time. A few extraneous scenes could've been snipped as well, including the introductory scenes at the bar that repeat information we already know and also keep the running time going, and most of the time simply elicit a feeling of wanting to move along and get to the good scenes. These really harm the film.\r\n\r\nRated PG-13: Language, Mild Violence and intense demonic and spiritual themes."

Though it made the biopic more graceful by concentrating on the earlier times, it would have been more complete had it also included her later, troubled times, punctuated with brushes with the law and institutionalization for schizophrenia, as well as being greatly financially troubled due to not getting royalties for her years of photo-work and celebrity. Thankfully, late in life, that was rectified and she was able to live her last years decently and in happiness, dying of a heart attack at 85, three years after seeing Harron's work come to light, and her success come full circle..."

A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she\u2019s too old at 32 and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t train girls,\u201d probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the film is basically a female version of \u201cRocky\u201d (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it\u2019s touching.\r\n\r\nThe third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I \u2018get\u2019 the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what\u2019s (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a dark turn that leaves a sour taste because it refutes the positive message of the first two-thirds of the story.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

Not only does it use the silly costumes that I like from comics, but it incorporates it as part of normal life: the world is clearly built to show that Supers are somewhat normal to see, and that there is a community of them.  It's basically Professor X's school if people treated Mutants like the Avengers.\r\n\r\nThe immediate problems are in the the casting: there are SO MANY great people, almost everyone is funny and takes to their roles perfectly, but the lead, the focus of the story, is forgettable, and it is completely unbelievable that he would have these girls after him, let alone someone who we're happy to have powers.  And I hate Kurt Russell, but the movie is so good I forget he's in it until he suddenly appears and smarms it up.\r\n\r\nA \"coming of age\" story, with \"high school politics\", and \"girl next door\" tropes all mixed together is a good recipe, and with super powers to keep it interesting.  I think that's the thing that makes this movie stand out.  Using the super powers, the movie is all about SHOW, don't tell.  A lot of movie forget this, overusing narration and dialogue out of place.\r\n\r\nThe content of the movie is all about meaningful dialogue, showing the world, and how it works.  It is also about being fun, they pay special detail to the scenes to keep it light and add something extra to the scenes.  Another thing that comedy movies forget is that a joke should compliment the movie, not stop it: there are so many little bits sewn into the movie that happen to the side (Larry being a 2-ton rock at a party), or as part of the world building (a hero support montage of utility belts).\r\n\r\nThe oddest parts of the movie deal with teens dating and their parents, it's perfectly apt, but you can feel the awkwardness of the situation.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever liked any super hero anything, then give this a go, you'll probably like it."

It's just so basic and limp that it struggles to entertain at all, I'd even question if the younger audience would even like it.\r\n\r\nThe elephant in the room is also that's practically a rip-off of DreamWorks' <em>'Madagascar'</em>, which was released roughly one year prior. If we're comparing the two, <em>'The Wild'</em> is weaker in every area - and I'm not even a massive fan of that 2005 film.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's disappointing, it's not just dull but also quite jarring in parts. The cast aren't much better, I wouldn't say any of them are bad but none of them are memorable one bit - if you force me to pick a noteworthy member, it would be Eddie Izzard's koala. Kiefer Sutherland (Samson) and William Shatner (Kazar) should standout, but simply do not.\r\n\r\nThe story is shallow, predictable and boringly by the numbers. I expect much more from Disney, it's safe to say. Up until this point in time, it's definitely their worst animated release that isn't a sequel/spin-off.\r\n\r\nNot even the short run time could save this. Shame."

Plus it stays near enough to the sci-fi genius of the author to satisfy the fans of the classic novel. I will say that I got a little tired of the son acting like such a teenager, but he and the Tom Cruise character both show some character growth by the end of the film. Tom is one of those actors who seems to be playing himself a lot, but I suspect there is a lot more work to it than that. I'm not sure Dustin Hoffman would have gotten his Academy Award for Rain Man if he had played off a lesser actor than Cruise. \r\n\r\nI think there are a couple of scenes the movie could have done without, such as in the cellar with Cruise, his daughter and the man who lived there. It slowed the story down, changed the tenor of the drama, and didn't add a lot, in my view. But it is what it is and overall I found War of the Worlds to be entertaining. Good science fiction movies can be hard to find."

This was controversial when it took in a cartload of Oscars, particularly finally a directorial nod for Scorsese, but don't be misled--it's easily one of his finest works.\r\n\r\nThis is my Golden Rule on both remakes in general, but especially American remakes of international (particularly foreign-language) great films. When in doubt, check the label:\r\n\r\n1. Director? (check)\r\n2. Cast? (check)\r\n3. Script? (check)\r\n\r\n'The proof is in the pudding!'"

After this watch, I'm thinking this is from where \"Benchwarmers\" might have been inspired.\r\n\r\nI think it's more of the \"misfits working together\" trope that gets me, and you see it in lots of kids sports movies: \"Kicking & Screaming\", \"The Sandlot\", \"Little Giants\", \"Mighty Ducks\".\r\n\r\nThis rolls in a lot of adult humor as well, so while you might have to have a few talks with your kids (which you should have had before watching a movie that would unexpectedly prompt them), but I think it's a movie that the whole family could actually watch.\r\n\r\nIt's not great, but it was fun."
