He awakes in what appears to be a heavenly place, and much to his surprise he is visited by a deity and told that he is on probation, he is in short...almost an angel.\r\n\r\nPaul Hogan will forever be known as the bloke from Crocodile Dundee, a highly efficient fish out of water comedy that became a huge hit. However, the sequels and his other subsequent film's are either roundly ignored or highly frowned upon. That's a shame because Almost An Angel is a very engaging comedy, the sort of picture that stands up like a Capraesque piece for the 90s. It's the sort of fable that cheers one up when the blues draw in and then turn into a blackly dark cloud, yes it be true, old craggy faced Paul Hogan has the gift of comedy. True enough the doses of sentiment are at times like a treacle itch to be scratched, but is that a bad thing? Watching a street wise criminal turning his less than honourable skills into a thing of goodness?\r\n\r\nThe film has many visual gags to go with the ream of religious ones that flow within the piece, be it Hogan attempting to fly or a quiet word about Elvis, Almost An Angel delights if one accepts the nature of the beast. Linda Kozlowski again teams up with Hogan (after the earlier Crocodile Dundee pairing), here she has very little to do but she slots in very nicely, even if a pre-end credits sequence does her and everyone else no favours at all. The best actor on show is the criminally undervalued Elias Koteas, playing the wheelchair bound Steve Garner, he exudes a believability factor that many modern day actors can learn from, where, the ability to act with just your face is high art if it's done correctly. Check out both the first and last scenes that Koteas shares with Hogan, great stuff that seems to have been forgotten due to the disdain shown for this particular film.\r\n\r\nI rate it 7/10 because it hits my spot when I need a pick me up, perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in? But don't believe the low rating here on this site, it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect, but hell! It's a heavenly piece knowingly incorporating the serious side of religious beliefs."

A strong supporting cast of character actors file in to make some easy money, with the likes of Brion James, Ed O'Ross, Brent Jennings and Kevin Tighe at least proving to be reassuring presences.\r\n\r\nMurphy and Nolte jostle, fight each other and swear a lot, which would be OK were it not already done so much better in the first film. All things considered, it's a no brainer really to suggest you watch the first film instead. 5/10"

Unfortunately something has hitched a ride in his coffin...\r\n\r\nMixing \"B\" movie conventions with a modern day fun sensibility, Arachnophobia sees Frank Marshall direct and Jeff Daniels, Julian Sands, John Goodman and Harley Jane Kozak line up in the cast. Though horror and comedy on the surface doesn't seem to be a that hard to blend together, it's actually surprising over the years just how few horror comedy movies can claim to be successful, and crucially, have been able to to win over a like minded audience. In fact, if we move away from the likes of \"Sean Of The Dead\", the \"B\" movie creature feature, especially in modern times, has few offerings of worth. We can certainly mention the awesome (and best of the modern bunch) \"Tremors\", which turned a small Worldwide profit, and then we turn to \"Lake Placid\" and \"Arachnophobia\". Both of the latter made considerable amounts of cash (for the genre) and are propelled by a degree of star wattage. \r\n\r\nWhat was in Arachnophobia's favour was that spiders strike the fear of god into many people, thus, as director Marshall said himself on the publicity junket, \"People like to be scared but still laughing at the same time\".  Arachnophobia achieves this in spades, mixing real spiders (the Avondale breed) with model and magnet work, where the effect achieved is full on nervy giggles coupled with some creepy goose flesh also putting in an appearance.\r\n\r\nThe cast work hard to make it work. OK, Sands remains as wooden as he always is, but in this case his pompous bug professor actually calls for it. Daniels as the modern doctor hoping to start a new life in the country, is an excellent lead, a fine actor who's no show on the \"A\" list of Hollywood remains an utter mystery. However, it's with the big jolly blunderbuss that is John Goodman where the pic gets its frothy \"B\" movie fun. His inept, half witted but knowing pest controller, Delbert, engages in that small town Americana way. He is an innocent to the terrors of the world and that makes for a nice play off with the Arachnophobic Dr. Ross Jennings (Daniels). \r\n\r\nNicely shot around Cambria, California, to fully realise the small town under arachnid siege, Arachnaphobia is the perfect comedy creeper for all the family to enjoy. So squirm and giggle together and watch out for any creepy crawlies in the corners of your home...  7/10"

I'm back from the future.\r\n\r\nDoc Brown is back in 1885 in the Old West, soon to be joined by Marty who has found that Doc is in mortal danger from Burford \"Mad-Dog\" Tannen.\r\n\r\nRounding out what turned out to be a hugely popular trilogy, Back to the Future Part III restored the core essence heart of Part 1, whilst simultaneously tying up all the threads with a fully formed story. More sedate in its telling (not hard following on from the manic pacing of part 2) part 3 fuses science fiction malarkey with, well, Western malarkey. All played out with the usual array of clever jokes and series reprises - only in a Wild Wild West setting. An interesting point to note is how the roles of Doc & Marty have been reversed from the first film, here Marty is the maniacal plot axis, whizzing around getting into scrapes as Doc ambles around in love, courtesy of the delightfully classic looking Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton. Thomas F. Wilson returns for villain duties as Tannen, a Western bully villain pulled straight out of many a classic Oater from way back in the day, and Lea Thompson & Elisabeth Shue ensure the \"past\" is not forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale started making Back To The Future in 1985, could they have envisaged that they would make three films and end up with a steam engine time machine in the Wild West? Possibly not, but as part 3 hurtles (literally) towards the suspense laden finale, two things are for certain. One is that they wisely closed the series down with a surefire coda winner. Two is that between them they crafted one of the most entertaining family trilogies to have ever graced the screen. No doubt about the fact that part one is the uniformly class act of the three, but parts two & three themselves reward groups of all ages. Great Scot indeed. 8.5/10"

Liam Neeson plays Dr. Peyton Westlake, a super scientist who after a major run-in with the villainous Robert G. Durant (Larry Drake), reinvents himself as Darkman, a super-anti-hero who sets about ridding L.A. of its mobsters.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a comic book film that isn\u2019t based on a comic book, Raimi inventing his own tortured protagonist whilst homaging similar beings of eras past. All the silliness of such fare is here of course, overblown violence and colourful characters are frequent, but there\u2019s good thought gone into the revenge theme, while the action sequences are often excellent. The pace hardly sags, as Raimi\u2019s creations move about a Los Angeles that is equally decaying or affluent, and in Neeson the story has a lead actor with swagger, pathos and emotional force in abundance. 7/10"

            "review": "A bit too mellow yellow.\r\n\r\nDick Tracy is directed by Warren Beatty and written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. Based on Chester Gould\u2019s comic strip creation of the same name, it stars Beatty, Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly, Dustin Hoffman, Charlie Korsmo, Charles Durning and William Forsythe. Music is by Danny Elfman, with songs by Stephen Sondheim, and cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro.\r\n\r\nPunk Rock band X-Ray Spex once sang about The Day The World Turned Day-Glo, Warren Beatty\u2019s Dick Tracy was exactly that. The live action cartoon is a feast for the eyes, as the city backdrop for this cops and gangsters tale is a fountain of bright, lurid primary colours. The characters are drawn brilliantly, where the good guys are very much human, but the bad guys are a bunch of grotesques, like a mutant gathering under one coalition banner. All star casting, striking costuming, amazing effects work, quality songs and a brisk musical score (Elfman reworks his score for Batman from the previous year), Dick Tracy as a production is grade \u201cA\u201d stuff. It also did very well at the box office, where although it didn\u2019t reach Disney\u2019s expectation levels financially, it coined to the tune of over $100 million in profit Worldwide. Not bad for a film some still think was a flop!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a film that feels a lot better watching it now than it did back on release, to be able to view it as a smart technical accomplishment for the time it was made. The cast factor also makes it something of a fascinating experience, watching legends like Pacino and Hoffman absolutely buy into the cartoon excess on show. However, the old problem with it just will never go away. Yes the plot is very simple, but that\u2019s easy to accept these days, it was after all a gangster movie made for all the family, it\u2019s that Beatty\u2019s portrayal of Tracy is too under played. He\u2019s a good guy, we know that, we are on his side, but it\u2019s a flat characterisation, he\u2019s never pushed to be anything other than a cool dude. This of course lets the monstrous villains take the film by the scruff of the neck, as most villains tend to anyway, but for a film carrying his name, you expect a bit more from Dick Tracy the man.\r\n\r\nStill, Dick Tracy is a fun movie experience, not all it can be, but enjoyable regardless. 7/10"

The premise of the story is so superb and was ripe for a terrifying horror film, but Flatliners then, and now, is not terrifying, but that actually doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 some of the more bright young acting prospects were off making Memphis Belle, the other half that was made up of potential Brat Packers like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt and Kevin Bacon, were joining director Joel Schumacher for this delve into life after death experiments. \r\n\r\nThe tyro medical students, led by a darkly egotistical Sutherland, begin inducing their own deaths to see what awaits once the flatline has been reached. Seems great at first, but as the students push the time limits of being dead still further, what comes into their real worlds is actually not welcome.\r\n\r\nPic is never close to being frightening, but the thematics involved are chilling and the big message at its heart is loud and clear. At times it's an uneasy blend of supernatural dalliances and medical science, but the breezy cast hold engagement, while cinematographer Jan de Bont's misty lenses are perfectly in the realm of the ethereal. 7/10"

Naturally this isn't one for the taste conscious highbrow peeps, for this is a purposely bloody tongue in cheek black comedy horror farce. It's awash with exploding body parts, chaotic everyday Americana scenarios and plenty of gloopy schlock. Cast are in on the joke and deliver perfectly low-key perfs, with the gorgeous Patty Mullen deliciously riffing on \"Bride of Frankenstein's\" classic worth.\r\n\r\nFrom jigsaw death by lawnmower to a superb twist in the tale at pic's end, this is a riot for the so inclined towards low-brow horror comic bookery. 6/10"

It\u2019s that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It\u2019s grade \u201cA\u201d film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.\r\n\r\nThe story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi\u2019s non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It\u2019s often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not romanticism here, if anything it\u2019s a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s.

A good watch if you're into cyberpunk."

Not even Martin Lawrence who I usually find hilar is funny.\r\n\r\n Some scenes were okay (the battle rap scene stood out the most, the only scene I thoroughly enjoyed) but overall nah. A pretty tame comedy, and too much focus came to thinking about how Kid's eraser head hair do looked for me.\r\n\r\nWatch 'HANGIN WITH THE HOMEBOYS' with Doug E Doug and John Leguizamo instead, or 'FRIDAY' with Cube or yeah why not 'CLASS ACT'."

The cast aren't all that, while the cinematography and editing isn't amazing. The dialogue is basic, as is the premise - which feels as if it has taken different parts from the studio's other work.\r\n\r\nThose include <em>'Treasure Island'</em>, <em>'Kidnapped'</em>, <em>'In Search of the Castaways'</em> and <em>'Swiss Family Robinson'</em>. The source material by Oluf Falck-Ytter is apparently inspired by some of the same things as those are, so I guess it's no surprise. Either way, I'm not convinced Disney needed to tackle this area once again.\r\n\r\nI will say, by the conclusion, I did feel content enough with the film; helped by the short run time, no doubt. Straightforward and a little plain, but narrowly enjoyable."

            "review": "John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop assigned to put a killer named Crisp behind bars for good. To do so, Kimble needs to find Crisp's son and ex-wife. All he knows for certain is the name of the small Oregon town where the live and that the boy is kindergarten age. Kimble goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to try to find the boy. Even though he's a tough cop on a mission, Kimble realizes, to his amazement, that he enjoys teaching the kids. He also finds a love interest in one of the other teachers, Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) - a single mother whose son is in Kimble's class. And, as luck would have it, Kimble discovers that Joyce is Crisp's ex-wife. How convenient! Kimble will have to act fact, though, because Crisp is on his way to collect his son.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, Kindergarten Cop is an enjoyable movie. Schwarzenegger seems naturally unnatural around the kids, but that works in the film's favor. Kimble should be awkward around his class. There are a number of humorous interactions between the un-humorous Kimble and the kids - my favorite being his reaction to the kid obsessed with death. Good stuff. As awkward as Schwarzenegger is around the children, it's the exact opposite when it comes to his co-star, Miller. There's a nice chemistry between the two that really shows on-screen. I would have loved to see the pair make more movies together. Another plus for kindergarten cop is Pamela Reed playing Kimble's partner. Reed is always good and gives a solid performance here. Throw in some nice action toward the film's conclusion and Kindergarten Cop ends up being a nice experience. \r\n\r\nI do, however, have two complaints. First, the film is too long. I really think that if just 10 to 15 minutes were cut from the runtime, it would be a better, tighter movie. Cut the scenes with Cathy Moriarty, for example. They add zilch to the final product. Second, baddie Crisp and his mother aren't threatening enough. They're jokes. Had the pair been played with a more menacing tone, the final showdown would have been even better. Still, it's a solid film as is."

But after reuniting with his loyal and violence hungry gang, he finds the odds are very much stacked up against him. Not only has New York changed for the worse, being run by incompetent pretenders to his crown, but the police force are also after his head - dead or alive!\r\n\r\nFirst time viewers to this picture should not go into it expecting some Scarface type gangster movie, I made that mistake almost 17 years ago and came out the cinema totally cheesed off! Revisiting the film now has opened up a whole new ream of delights that when put together have created a simmering and brutal piece of work. What director Abel Ferrara has managed to do here is portray a fable of how a leopard never changes its spots - even though it wants too. Frank White is here a victim of his own past doings, with his reputation on the wane and the authorities with long and unforgiving memories.\r\n\r\nWhat hits the most (outside of some brilliant acting) is Abel Ferrara's bleak yet gorgeous vision of a sin city Big Apple, the characters are all one step away from a death, something that we the audience hope comes swift and nasty, all of which is cloaked in this plink plink lighted vision of the underworld. Ferrara chooses to pace his picture to give us a sense of pervading doom, it's quite a knack and means the viewers have to hang on in there to get to the wonderful, and dare I say it, bleakly appropriate conclusion.\r\n\r\nChristopher Walken is Frank White and gives one of his best career performances, all scary eyes and dialogue spurting precision, he pours out grit and emotion to garner sympathy where he perhaps really shouldn't be getting it. Larry Fishburne, David Caruso, Victor Argo, Wesley Snipes, Janet Julian and Steve Buscemi fill out the cast list, with Fishburne and his manic Jimmy Jump character practically walking off with the movie. So all in all it's a visual delight and a story that is very good on the ears, with the violence perfectly harsh to flesh out the grim nature of this pot boiling crime picture.\r\n\r\nSo, those in need of a pick me up should probably steer well clear then. 8/10"

Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good - bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions. It's a standard story line that is still providing cinematic water for many a film maker these days, but shot through the Coen prism, with literary astuteness holding court, it's a genre piece of considerable class. A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.\r\n\r\nWhen the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade \"A\" thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters, but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the byzantine with the labyrinthine, keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.\r\n\r\nVisually the film is superb, the hard working sweat of the city dovetails impudently with the mother nature beauty of Miller's Crossing the place, a place home to misery, a witness to the dark side of man. All the while Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito bring an array of characterisations to the party, each one his own man but each craftily proving the folly of man. Marcia Gay Harden, in one of her first mainstream roles, slinks about making the two main boys sweaty, and wonderful she is as well. While Carter Burwell provides a musical score that has a smug (in a good way) self awareness about it.\r\n\r\nStyle over substance? Yes, on formative viewings it is. But go back, look again, see and sample what is not being said. Pulpers and noirers will I'm sure get the gist. 8/10"

Ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship, he's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot. Then one night his car breaks down again. Walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck, Larry happens upon barman Mike, who unbeknown to Larry is about to change his life for ever...\r\n\r\nThe alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing, stretching back to the likes of It's A Wonderful Life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It's a sub-genre of fantasy that has over the years produced very mixed results. Back in 1990 was this James Belushi led production, rarely mentioned when the said topic arises, it appears that it has largely been forgotten. Which is a shame, for it oozes charm and is high scoring in the humour department. We know that we are being led to the ultimate message come the end, but it's still a fun and enjoyable path to be led down. The film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor James Belushi was. I mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn't your thing? then chances are you would avoid this film anyway. But for those engaged by the likes of Red Heat, K-9 and Taking Care of Business, well Mr. Destiny is right up your street. Along for the ride are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox.\r\n\r\nMr. Destiny is pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart. 7/10"

Surprising, then, to find it still works to the point of being viable. It's a very effective zombie pic, one performed with quality by the cast, with the concept of a group of people holed up in a house - under intense attack by the walking dead - still terrifying. It helps to cast Tony Todd in a reimaging of a horror classic, while Patricia Tallman is a fine spunky lead lady horror protag.\r\n\r\nGroup dynamics again explode, heroes and villains are born, and the creatures are high grade in scary construction. Caveat, though, is that although it's a faithul(ish) remake, where with the new tools to hand it's understandable why the makers thought they could create another horror classic, but one for the 90s horror hordes, it still remains that it's utterly bloodless.

Badham's work was okay in my books, but nothing spectacular. Over the years I had loved those films of his I had seen ('Leon: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', 'The Family' and 'Lucy'), and decided I wanted to see his earlier classic. I like the fact that Besson always has some hand in the writing, and the exquisite and graceful small part he wrote for acting legend Jeanne Moreau, virtually a microcosm of everything splendid she had ever brought to the screen. Besson has a very good feel for the genres his films represent--he plays to his strengths, and is not afraid to stick to his guns (for example, I'm glad he chose the ending that he did). The two significant extras on my DVD, remarking on the making of the film, and the sound selections by scorer Eric Serra, were both informative and entertaining, and added significant value. I highly recommend the experience to those who only think of 'The Fifth Element' when they think of Luc's work--you're in for a real treat..."

Yet I personally feel that Predator 2 stands up to scrutiny as a fine entry into the sci-fi/action genre. Locating it among the urban decay of L.A. works real well, and pitting the Predator against a tough grizzled (but hardly giganticus beefcakeus) cop (Danny Glover) gives us a smart brains against brawn story. Also cutely is that director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim & John Thomas have actually got the Predator cleaning up the streets of L.A., in fact another two hours of Predator hunt and kill tactics and crime in L.A. would have been completely eradicated! There is plenty of bloody snotty gore to appease fans of that persuasion, and it's nice to report that the characters on show do actually impact as part of the story.\r\n\r\nVoodoo magic man!\r\n\r\nIt has a fine cast that reads like a who's who of action films, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Robert Davi (Die Hard), Gary Busey (Under Siege), Rub\u00e9n Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico) & Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man), whilst Kevin Peter Hall dons the Predator suit and suitably kicks arse again. It's not genius, it's not even ground breaking, but Predator 2 is a fine and entertaining genre piece that sadly seems to forever be undervalued on internet forums.\r\n\r\nWho's Next?  8/10"

It stars Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, Bonnie Bedelia, Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, Paul Winfield, John Spencer and Greta Scacchi. Music is scored by John Williams and Richard Wolf, and cinematography is by Gordon Willis.\r\n\r\nProsecuting attorney Rusty Sabich (Ford) suddenly finds himself a murder suspect after his one time lover, Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi), is found raped and murdered in her home. As the evidence piles up against him, and his marriage comes under further strain, Rusty hires top lawyer Sandy Stern (Juli\u00e1) to represent him when the case goes to trial. Battling the system that he knows inside out, Rusty finds that there's a big can of worms about to be opened.\r\n\r\nA tip top court room mystery drama that we could do with seeing more of these days. Expertly strung together by the director of All the Presidents Men and Sophie's Choice, Presumed Innocent isn't just a by the numbers legal who done it? The makers get in deep with the political machinations of a district attorney's office, the intricate steps of a police investigation, and of course the legal eagle operations of a court room. In to the mix is an horrendous crime, of which a lawyer himself is charged with committing, he may or may not be guilty of the crime, but wonderfully we are never sure until the astonishing finale plays out. The air of mystery hangs heavy throughout, nagging away like an itch you can't scratch, with Pakula neatly unfolding the drama in a collage of flashbacks, side-plots and present time intricacies. Mood is heightened by the photography of Gordon Willis, who along with Pakula's looming camera work, manages to convey a claustrophobic feel in keeping with an unstable marriage and a court room itself.\r\n\r\nA great cast is assembled for the picture. Ford expertly plays it low key, brooding intently, he makes us unsure as to his guilt or innocence, and that's a testament to how good his performance is. Bedelia is excellent as the stoic wife, holding it together as the marital cracks begin to appear, and Juli\u00e1 dominates the second half of the picture as we shift to the court room. Dennehy does a nice line in morally compromised smarm, and Scacchi wonderfully exudes a femme fatale sexuality. Winfield is a mighty presence as the judge presiding over such a tricky case, and Spencer is as reliable as ever. Only disappointments come with the performances of Joe Grifasi and Tom Mardirosian, who as the prosecutors come across as wimpy and hardly brick tight lawyers trying a high profile murder case.\r\n\r\nAn intense and intellectual adult drama, Presumed Innocent is one of the best of its type from the modern era. 8.5/10"

            "review": "A street credibility Pygmallion!\r\n\r\nEdward Lewis is a very rich man, but money, as everyone knows, does not buy everything, and as yet another failed relationship falls by the wayside, Edward faces up to the prospect of a hectic social week on his own. Enter a meeting with ebullient hooker Vivian Ward, who upon impressing Edward with her happy go lucky values, gets herself hired to be his escort for the week ahead, it's a week that both of them are unlikely to ever forget.\r\n\r\nIt almost became the in thing to stomp all over the respective work of both Richard Gere (Edward) and Julia Roberts (Vivian), adding fuel to the fire of those with an aversion to both actors is that the crowd pleasing Pretty Woman hails from that dreaded genre known as 1980s Rom-Com. Seemingly many can now not see just what made Pretty Woman so popular back in 1990. Gary Marshall's film was the fourth highest box office taker in 1990, grossing a domestic $178,406,268, and at the same time made the date movie hip again, so basically all you Pretty Woman haters can take both those facts to the bank!\r\n\r\nAs the opening credits emerge, Peter Cox (lead singer of pop band Go West) starts warbling about \"The King Of Wishful Thinking\", and never was a more appropriate song used to open such a genre piece before or since, and this is the key issue with Pretty Woman. Yes, the whole structure and plot devices are all fanciful splendour, I mean does anyone seriously think that hookers look and act like Julia Roberts? But really if you are entering this picture expecting anything other than a modern \"My Fair Lady\" like fairytale then the blinkers need to be well and truly taken off. It's also a point of worth to say that Pretty Woman has something to say outside of the main intention to lift hearts and make one smile, Marshall, aided by his screenwriter J.F. Lawton, tie in smartly the fact that Edward is as much a hustler as Vivian is, only difference being that Edward is incredibly wealthy and has therefore grown in public stature.\r\n\r\nBoth Roberts and Gere have brilliant chemistry, so it was no surprise to see they would work together again in 1999 on \"Runaway Bride\", and both actors are helped immeasurably by splendid support from Hector Elizondo as the hotel manager, Barney Thompson. The picture is laced with joyous moments that hark back to the golden days of screwy comedies laced with unlikely romances, and this was something that clearly struck a chord with cinema goers back on the film's original release. Yes it's a touch over sweet at times, and yes the ending is never really in doubt, but if you are prepared to invest some fluffy chilled out time with Pretty Woman then you can see and feel just why it was the big hit it was back at the start of the 90s. 8/10"

The five Dirty Harry films, right? Or \u201cThe Gauntlet\u201d (1977)? All great or near-great Eastwood cop pictures. So you'd expect the same from 1990's \u201cThe Rookie,\u201d costarring Charlie Sheen as the sidekick. Well, you'd be wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething keeps \u201cThe Rookie\u201d from attaining the heights of those other Eastwood cop films. It even pales compared to \u201cTightrope\u201d (1984) and \u201cBlood Work\u201d (2002). Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some entertaining elements and the thrills certainly pick up in the overblown last act, but the flick\u2019s too contrived and even falls into camp territory at times.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sheen\u2019s unconvincing as a tough cop who can singlehandedly take down a bar on the wrong side of town, not to mention the miscasting of Latino\u2019s Raul Julia and Sonia Braga as German villains. While Braga is stunning, she\u2019s not utilized to her potential; neither is Lara Flynn Boyle. Meanwhile Tom Skerritt is wasted in a trivial role as Sheen's rich dad.\r\n\r\nSo this is a disappointing, even laughable Eastwood cop flick and rightly forgotten. The constant macho f-bombs don't help. Still, there are enough engaging moments to make it worth catching if you can laugh with it.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C-"

The wrap-around story was fine with a fun conclusion I guess. **3.5/5**"

All the practical effects, exquisite violence & nudity and provocative sci-fi themes you've come to expect from this sort of thing, but twists and turns that start just five minutes in and keep running all the way through to the end. _Total Recall_ is a must-see.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"

The reason? Giant underground worms are attacking the place and they are now needed more than ever.\r\n\r\nThe 50s ream of sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features are, depending on your persuasion, either genius fun or tacky nuisances. Since I belong to the first group, Tremors is possibly one of the finest homages to a most wonderful time in cinema. What is often ignored is that those 50s film's deal with the paranoia of the time, with nuclear testing and a wondering appertaining to Roswell like alien visits being very prominent in honest Joe's thoughts. So it be that Tremors is ideally set out in the desert, a place from where all manner of terrifying things have come forward to announce a threat to the American way of life.\r\n\r\nWe are in the small town of Perfection, a place that may be small on residents, but very much large on character. We have dim wits, annoying kid, cutesy single mom types, Mr and Mrs Rambo and courtesy of Finn Carter's seismologist Rhonda LeBeck, a romantic and charmingly fun filled thread. Containing dashes of gore and reams of cheeky suspense, Tremors proudly wears its \"B\" movie heart on its sleeve. While in Fred Ward (Earl) and Kevin Bacon (Val) the genre possibly has its greatest pairing. As male buddy buddy combos go, these pair take the cake. Funny and full of devilish derring do, Tremors deserves to be watched for this partnership if nothing else - yes they are that good! The creatures are well designed and prove to be a scary and enjoyable foe, whilst the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California location is perfectly utilised by cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski. Directed by Ron Underwood on his feature film debut, Tremors also sees Reba McEntire, Michael Gross and Victor Wong also along for this fun packed ride. 8/10"

Can't afford to be afraid of our own people anymore, man.  \r\n\r\n1991 \r\n\r\n\"One out of every twenty-one Black American males will be murdered in their lifetime\"\r\n\r\n\"Most will die at the hands of another Black male\"\r\n\r\n\"Increase The Peace\" is the closing message of John Singleton's powerful, intelligent and affecting call for calm in South Central Los Angeles. Often mistakenly presumed by those who haven't seen it to be a film that glamorises violence, Singleton's debut film takes us into South Central and holds us there by just shooting the story. No trickery or overtly moralistic posturing from the director (and writer), just an unpretentious look at life in a modern ghetto.\r\n\r\nThe story follows three black teenagers as they ponder on what life holds for them as adulthood lurches from around the corner. Brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) and best friend Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr), each have the usual worries that come with leaving the teenage years behind. Parents, girls, careers, not returning to the pen! But this is no ordinary coming of age drama, we have been party to this neighbourhood that these boys live in. This is a place where a trip to the store can get you killed in a drive by shooting. A place where those keen to learn and do their homework have their muse shattered by the frequent sound of gunshots and sirens filling the South Central night.\r\n\r\nThough Singleton can be accused of painting some of his characters as too saintly, he should be forgiven since this is after all, a message movie. Besides which his portrait of this particular neighbourhood is done from honest memory since he himself be a former youth of South Central LA. There in lies one of Boyz's trump cards, Singleton, through his own observations, asks of those in \"The Hood\" to take responsibility for what they do. Something that is potently given narrative credence courtesy of Tre's father's (a fabulous understated Laurence Fishburne) deep musings. Once the built up tension explodes with the inevitable tragedy that all should be ready for, the impact is like a sledgehammer hitting bone. Not in a blood letting for impact sake, but with the aftermath as a family soaks up the situation. It gives 90s cinema one of its most affecting and damning scenes, one that once viewed is hard to fully shake out of the memory bank. Here Singleton could possibly have bowed out of the story, but he goes further, expanding the aftermath and taking us, along with the characters, to the final \"Increase The Peace\" d\u00e9nouement.\r\n\r\nIt's been called everything from an After School Special to the most important Black American movie made thus far. I agree with the last assessment. 9/10"

It stars Warren Beatty, Annette Benning, Harvey Keitel, Ben Kingsley, Elliott Gould and Joe Mantegna. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Allen Daviau. Film is a biography adaptation of Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, a notorious American mobster who rose to prominence in the 30s and 40s.\r\n\r\nBarry Levinson\u2019s epic film didn\u2019t turn out to be the mobster film many had hoped for. There was great anticipation that this would be Levinson\u2019s Goodfellas. What ultimately came to pass was a film of epic scope and detail, alive not with violence and mobster edginess, but of romanticism, of visionary peccadilloes and of folly. This is both a blessing and a curse, for Levinson seems to be caught in two minds between being respectful to his main characterisation, or unleashing the beast as we know it.\r\n\r\nStory concerns itself with Siegel being sent to tidy up West Coast operations, from where he would fall in love with starlet Virginia Hill and become one of the most prominent names in Hollywood of the 40s. Whilst the pic has moments where Siegel seethes and teeters on the edge of murderous rage, much of the history here is scratchy to say the least, where again Levinson and Toback ignore just what a nasty piece of work Siegel was in real life, and instead put dreamy ideals and hot to trot passions in instead.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all perfectly mounted, this is very good film making, it just always seems to be on the periphery of making a telling contribution to the Siegel legacy on film. Beatty is dandy and ever watchable, but this is not a Bugsy Siegel we can identify with, rendering an air of falseness to the story telling. The support cast are strong, though Mantegna as George Raft is miscast, but the likes of Kingsley and Gould make telling contributions with only morsels to feed off of from the screenwriter.\r\n\r\nIn its longest form it runs at two and half hours, and it\u2019s testament to the film maker's craft that it always maintains interest. Yet the various splinters trying to dovetail into one never quite make it and that\u2019s a shame. 6.5/10"

            "review": "Meet Max Cady, the most terrific villain role De Niro ever played simply because he successfully portrayed a crook who possesses a very complex personality of being stone-cold, violent, absolutely merciless, also on the other hand quite witty and charismatic to ever lure Danielle Bowden (Juliette Lewis) into his trap when he pretended to be her drama teacher so convincingly. Martin Scorsese\u2019s Cape Fear tells the story of a brutal rapist who waited for so long just to be able to avenge his wrath towards Attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for he believed that Bowden could have done much better in defending for his case. This film is well-told with so many suspense elements through some shocking events throughout the film. \r\n\r\nCape Fear is one of the examples of film whose remake, in some ways, considered outwits the original one produced in 1962 starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. This is quite understandable remembering the remake was filmed many years later, with sufficient advancements in technology and financial supports. In Cape Fear, De Niro managed to portray the chilling Max Cady successfully. He had a best-laid plan to avenge his disappointments/hatred towards Bowden by studying laws in prison just to be able to find the flaws that in the end shall leave him untouchable by the law. \r\n\r\nSometimes it\u2019s amazing to understand how an actor/actress willing to go through for the sake of a role. Robert De Niro paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad for the role of Max Cady whereas right after filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed.  De Niro migh have been spectacular in portraying Cady but we also have to consider how remarkable and superb were Peck and Mitchum."

The jokes come vast and furious as do the sight gags. Jack Palance made a bit of a name for himself with his cowboy antics and one-armed pushups.\r\n\r\nMy favorite scene had nothing to do with dude ranch stuff. Mitch (Crystal) is explaining how a DVD recorder doesn\u2019t even require the tv to record a show, and his friend just isn\u2019t getting it. It\u2019s hilarious. This isn\u2019t a movie classic or anything, but plenty entertaining enough."

I know, I was expecting this as I started watching but the real reason behind me chicking on it was it hilarity and comic value, in this regard it didn't disappoint. So many elements not to be missed, his swarve sophistication, dayglo pants and bike allow him to bypass the laws of physics entirely when jumping fences, cars and entering buildings. His high class vocabulary never stops, mumling phrases in wanna-be rap gibberish \"Yo-yo, whatsup?\", \"sex me up\", \"you know, the chick that drives the horse\" and the ever famous \"drop that zero, get with the hero\". Everywhere he goes he just oozes coolness into the situation, strutting on stage indoors at night wearing sun glasses rapping away then dry humping the girl he's been stalking who is obviously still concussed from being thrown from a horse earlier due to his antics. This movie cost 6 Million dollars to make in 1991 (today in 2015 that figure would be close to 11 million), most of this of course went on his 1 million salary and 4.9 Million on his clothing and general wardrobe/props leaving the rest for its awesome production values. Watch this film though, its funny in a way that it was never intended, totally trashed the directors reputation for 8 years after and it was pulled from the cinema after 3 weeks. Its the E.T game in movie form"

            "review": "I KNOW I'm giving way too many stars for this, but I don't care; The Doors were one of my very first favourite groups. I fondly recall, when I was 11, and Elektra Records released 'The Doors' Greatest Hits', and the album-length version of 'Light My Fire' was played all the time on the radio, and I was mesmerized by the instrumental middle of the song, got the album from my parents for Christmas, and started a lifelong love affair with the band. Yes, Jim Morrison is highly overrated. Yes, the movie is an extremely self-indulgent mess and it can be quite incoherent and incohesive. But the Sixties, the L.A. rock scene back then, and especially Morrison's life, were just like that, so it is oh so fitting!\r\n\r\nI adore the fact that it was Oliver Stone's labour of love (one of thankfully many) and that the surviving members of the band basically had full input. I would take this and 'Talk Radio' (my personal favourite Stone's throw) over a hundred of Stone's politically over-the-top movies any day!\r\n\r\nWhen I was 17, I took my life savings and visited, on my own, nine European countries, including France and its capital, Paris. Did I go for the Eiffel Tower, wild romance on Richard Linklater-esque trains, or its outstanding magic and sidewalk cafes? No--train-wise I had to put up with a stupid labour strike, such that an overnight sleeper car from Berne, Switzerland to Paris had to be switched, in the middle of the night, FOUR times, just so they could prove a point. And it was just to see Morrison's grave. I met 20 fantastic people who had made the pilgrimage from all over the world, and it was my first time having red wine and smoking pot. The graffiti and the sculpture of him, in the Pere Lachaise cemetery, were fascinating, as was his life. Would I go through that again? Of course I would.\r\n\r\nIt's Val Kilmer's best work by a mile. The film just oozes charisma and breathes life--just as the band's work must have done back in the day. Worth a purchase and re-watches (I watch it each year on Jim's birthday and accidentally bought it twice), for any fan of 60's music or its culture. A bonafide classic when Stone was actually really something."

The trailer of the movie describe really well what the movie is about \"The story of a boy who lost the child in himself and the man that helps him find it\". It's my favorite movie written by John Huges and I'm a big John Huges fan. Ethan Randall/Embry plays his part really well,he was perfect for the role of Doyle,He made the transition between the angry rude Doyle of the beginning of the film to the normal 12 year old kid you see at the end looks very natural and his chemistry with Ed Oneil is fantastic.\r\n\r\nEd Oneil one of the most underrated actor in America just because of his Al Bundy persona.I Love Ed,I grew up watching Married with Children and I have seen most of his other project,Including Modern family, obviously and the new yet short lived \"Dragnet\" TV show.That guy got style and he's ten times more talented than some of the guys you see on the big screen these days, Dutch was in my opinion his best role so far.\r\n\r\nWell this film is a classic in my book and it has a great message to it. I'll give it a 8 out of 10."

            "review": "What if Peter Pan grew up and forgot who he was? What if he returned to Neverland?\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Steven Spielberg, \"Hook\" stars Robin Williams as a corporate American Lawyer who must go to the island of Neverland after his two kids are kidnapped in London by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). He has misadventures with the fairy Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts), pirates and a group of ragtag lost boys led by Rufio (Dante Basco); meanwhile hook tries to win the affections of his kids. Maggie Smith and Gwyneth Paltrow are on hand as older and younger versions of Wendy respectively.\r\n\r\nThis is a family-oriented adventure/fantasy/comedy cut from the same cloth as \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968), \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971), \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" (2004) and \"Into the Woods\" (2014); it\u2019s just not a musical like some of those flicks even though a song or two are featured. Depending on your tastes, \u201cHook\u201d is no better or worse than any of these movies (although \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is in a league of its own, of course).\r\n\r\nWhile I love serious swashbuckling, Peter Pan was always too kiddie/fantasy-based for my tastes. This is ironic since I have Peter Pan Syndrome, which Spielberg also admitted to; and my wife has The Wendy Dilemma (look \u2019em up). Fans of Peter Pan will favor this flick more than me.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was made by scores of talented people and contains some genuinely amusing moments (I busted out laughing at least four times). Hoffman\u2019s titular character is iconic. And Roberts works surprisingly well as Tinkerbell, but they should\u2019ve accented her beauty further. Speaking of which, the film needs more feminine sex appeal. Even the makers of \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201d knew enough to include a little bit.\r\n\r\nBoth Spielberg and Williams liked the two bookend sequences, but have reservations about the long Neverland middle-piece, which is the bulk of the picture. Williams admitted he felt lost in Neverland, probably because he was thrust from one misadventure to another so briskly. But the pre-CGI sets are colorful and imaginative; it\u2019s a fun movie with a lot of energy. Peter Pan just ain\u2019t my thang.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour, 22 minutes (overlong). WRITERS: James V. Hart, Nick Castle and Malia Scotch Marmo wrote the script based on concepts from the works of J.M. Barrie, particular \u201cPeter and Wendy\u201d (1911). BOX OFFICE: The movie cost $70 million (not including marketing) and made $301 million worldwide with $120 million of that domestically. While it was the fourth highest-grossing movie worldwide in 1991, it was still considered a disappointment by producers, the greedy bastages.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

Danny Aiello plays Hawk\u2019s partner and Andie MacDowell his maybe babe. James Coburn is on hand as a top CIA agent. \r\n\r\nThe film advertises right out of the gate that it\u2019s a goofy comedy, a parody of caper/spy flicks. The creators & cast bend over backwards to amuse the audience, but there are too few lulls to catch your breath. It\u2019s an almost constant barrage of over-the-top camp and comedy. I laughed several times, but too often I didn\u2019t. Still, it\u2019s a likable albeit curious throwaway comedy and should especially be worthwhile for fans of the cast. It cost an incredible $65 million (no doubt due to the costly globetrotting) and understandably flopped at the box office.     \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in California, New York, New Jersey, Italy, Vatican City, Hungary and London.

The jokes are constant and witty and Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans make a great onscreen buddy couple. Not to mention great cavalcade of bad guys. If 80's and 90's action is your cup of tea, this is definitely something you need to see!"

Demi Moore is one of the film's main revelations and she masters its wackiness with a strangely befitting coolness. Ackroyd <i>is</i> the wackiness, but that's only if you can recognize him under the genius of the makeup-grotesquery. \r\n\r\nAckroyd directs here as well as plays the hick judge of a-town-time-forgot and has a lot of fun playing with unsuspecting passers-through. The set pieces are inspired too and this truly is an odd yet fun ride, once it gets going. The only real contention is Chevy Chase who's a real stick in the mud - Tom Hanks was unfortunately busy."

This film shows a  cast that all including Stallone have good comedic timing, and a cast that play well off one another. The movie takes you back to some of the fast paced comedies of the 30s and 40s. Has some great cameos from older actors, as well as some unexpected performances. Chaz Palmieri  as a gangster is expected, but his character isn't what you expect. If you are a fan of a good play on words, sense of humor this is a must see. \r\nIt is one of those movies where even when you know what is going to happen you still laugh. This is often over looked, and under appreciated. If a few laughs, a break in your day is needed, this is one to put on your top ten list."

            "review": "***Iconic Medieval adventure of the early 90s***  \r\n\r\nReleased in 1991, \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" stars Kevin Costner in the title role. While some have argued that Costner was too humorless and brooding for the part, this is a cinematic myth. There are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than this and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative, etc.\r\n\r\nTo be honest with you, Costner was in his prime at the time and towers in the role; whether or not you like him is a matter of opinion. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marian is memorable with her unique facial features and odd hairstyle even though she doesn't trip my trigger. Morgan Freeman as the Moor Azeem is an excellent partner for Robin Hood while Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott are effective villains as the Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisborne respectively. Christian Slater, Nick Brimble and Michael McShane are also on hand as Robin's sometimes merry men, the latter two being Little John and Friar Tuck.\r\n\r\nI've always had mixed feelings about this movie due to its mixed tone and the fact that it loses its mojo in the last 45 minutes. Concerning the first, the flick is often serious and brutal, but it's also sometimes cartoonish and over-the-top. Rickman particularly hams it up, entertaining though he is. Another good example is Geraldine McEwan as the ee-vil witch Mortianna. Her portrayal is spooky and Gothic in a comic book horror kind of way, but it detracts from the many parts that establish the story as believable quasi-history. Still, she's excellent as the hideous witch. Another example is the semi-goofy, overly heroic action scenes, like Robin & Azeem being catapulted over the castle wall. Why sure!\r\n\r\nConcerning the second criticism, the movie is overlong by about 25 minutes. When the Celts attack the camp at the 95-minute mark I always start to lose interest and the rest of the movie is a tedious blur. But there\u2019s a lot of medieval action, if that\u2019s your thang.\r\n\r\nAs far as medieval films of the British Isles go, I prefer the more serious and consistent tone of \"Tristan + Isolde\" (2006) and \"First Knight\" (1995). Nevertheless, \u201cPrince of Thieves\u201d an entertaining Robin Hood adventure and is iconic of early 90's cinema. The entire first act is the best part followed by the many Sherwood Forest sequences. And the climatic cameo by a certain famous actor is a nice touch. I enjoy seeing \u201cPrince of Thieves\u201d every five years or so.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 143 minutes and was shot mostly in England, but also France. My wife loves the end credits\u2019 song \u201c(Everything I Do) I Do it for You\u201d by Bryan Adams.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

            "review": "Rocketeer is directed by Joe Johnston and co-written by Danny Bilson, Paul De Meo and William Dear. It is based on Dave Stevens' comic book The Rocketeer. It stars Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton and Paul Sorvino. Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Hiro Narita.\r\n\r\nIt took eight years to get to the screen, with many rewrites, changes in personal, changes in setting and etc, the only thing consistent was Disney's inconsistency. Once out the film received generally positive reviews but posted only a small profit, in the wake of a Tim Burton inspired reinvention of the Super Hero genre, Rocketeer fell away into cultdom, sequels planned were shelved and its reputation remains to this day one of being a misfire. Unfair say I! Rocketeer is a lovingly crafted adventure film, nodding towards the serials of the 1930s, it's awash with period Hollywood delights, Art Deco imagery, has a damsel in distress, square jawed heroics, Nazi villains, wonderful effects and a blunderbuss Zeppelin finale. Backed by beautiful smooth tone photography and an evocative heart stirring music score, it's a family friendly blockbuster that ticks all the requisite boxes. The quality of the action sequences still hold up today, and Johnston, who wanted the job big time, directs with a knowing grasp of the setting, and crucially he never once loses a grip on tone and pacing. There's no self parody here, no deep Fruedian dissection of the main character, just a honest to goodness good against bad axis, with a romantic cause deftly wafted over proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe role of Cliff Secord (Rocketeer) proved hard to cast, where Vincent D'Onofrio turned it down and \"name\" actors such as Dennis Quaid, Emilio Estevez, Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton auditioned for the part. Paxton, it's believed, was very close to getting it as well. Disney wanted an A list man, Johnny Depp and Kevin Costner were mooted, but Johnston had a feel for unknown Billy Campbell and managed to convince nervous Disney heads that he was perfect. Much of the scorn that has flown towards Rocketeer has landed at Campbell's door, again, this is unfair. It's hard to tell if one of those A list actors could have made the character work better, for it helps in this instance to not have a familiar face propelling the adventure. There's an innocence, an awkwardness to Campbell's portrayal that just sits right for a guy stumbling upon a rocket pack and finding himself submerged in a chase and harry battle against bad. He also has the looks, a handsome dude who creates a homespun based chemistry with the sensuous Connelly. It's Dalton's movie, though, he's having a devil of a time as the chief villain. Modeled on Errol Flynn and the spurious notion that he was once a Nazi spy, Dalton has the looks, the gusto, the moustache twirling shiftiness and a voice perfect for such material. A roll call of great character actors fill out the support slots, with Terry O'Quinn, Paul Sorvino and Ed Lauter particularly striking the right chords.\r\n\r\nA smashing piece of escapism, no pretensions or ideas above its station. The willingness to tap into the basic premise of a comic book actioner and entertain in grand Hollywood terms, to be applauded. And I do, and I do love it so. 8/10"

There are more bad guys than we've got bullets.\r\n\r\nIt's a buddy buddy action movie, one that feels more 80s than 90s, with that it has all the pluses and minuses that comes with such genre staples. Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee pair up to take on The Yakuza, Dolph has a very personal reason for tracking and killing the Yakuza leader. They are an odd pair who must get over their initial differences to complete their mission. Sound familiar? Well it is, because it can be seen in a whole host of other action buddy buddy movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting is sub-standard but the action is well constructed, which at the end of the day is what action fans require for a rollicking good time. Some of the dialogue is too cheese worthy to even pass as acceptable - and this in a genre that often demands it as a requisite, while the overt homoerotic undercurrents are either meant as tongue in cheek? Or an attempt by the makers to make some sort of action movie statement?\r\n\r\nIs it fun? Absolutely, and that's not just because of the ridiculous trousers Lundgren often wears (seriously, a leather jacket and Oxford bags?), while the colour photography is sparkling (Mark Irwin), but you have to have a taste for corn and cheese to get the most from this host. 5/10"

            "review": "Unlike a lot of viewers, I first saw _The Silence of the Lambs_ at five years old. So, for me, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite. Some would say I had an unusual childhood, in this age where some people actually **avoid** R-rated movies like the plague. The fact that I saw _Something Wild_, which Jonathan Demme directed five years before _The Silence of the Lambs_, as well as the original _Alien_ (alone at that), at the same age probably indicates that they were okay with me watching pretty much anything that wasn't rated X, though, honestly, I've **never** had any interest in that stuff. It was probably due to the fact that, like the movie's protagonist, I don't \"spook easily,\" and many so-called \"scary\" movies, including this one, never scared me, but (many of them) definitely thrilled me. Granted, I'd seen _Saving Private Ryan_ a few months before, which probably gave me a strong stomach. Well, enough about my wild, albeit fun, childhood. How does _The Silence of the Lambs_ hold up all these years later? For me personally, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is every bit as good as it was the first time I saw it at five years old.\r\n\r\nOn the off chance you don't already know the plot by now, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a rookie FBI agent with a degree in psychology who is called from training by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) in the middle of a string of murders by a man nicknamed \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, all of whom happen to be women. Crawford tells her to interview the psychotic Dr. Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison, hoping he might have an answer of some kind. Lecter brushes her off. After Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of a senator is kidnapped, Lecter agrees to give Starling information about Buffalo Bill on the condition that she tell him personal information about herself.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick the greatest Best Picture Oscar winner ever, it would most likely be _The Silence of the Lambs_. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, it's definitely my favorite.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the acting to start. Jodie Foster, unsurprisingly, won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as Starling. Foster plays Starling as a little scared yet strong at the same time, definitely not a coward as Julianne Moore later played the character in the movie _Hannibal_, and definitely not someone who would turn cannibal as Thomas Harris wrote the character as doing in the novel Hannibal. Movie or novel, in my honest opinion, the Clarice Starling depicted in _Hannibal_ is an insult to what this Clarice Starling stands for. As we find out about what's been nagging Starling since childhood, Foster plays it especially well where another actress may have overdone it.\r\nAnthony Hopkins, like Foster, won an Oscar for his performance as Lecter, and I speak for a lot of people, if not everybody, when I say it was also well-deserved. Hopkins plays Lecter as brilliant yet insane, making him one of the more interesting villains in movie history.\r\nScott Glenn plays Crawford very well for the time he's onscreen.\r\nTed Levine plays \"Buffalo Bill\" as straight up crazy, and does a very good job of making us hate him.\r\nBrooke Smith is only supposed to play Catherine Martin as scared and she does - with dead-on accuracy.\r\n\r\nTed Tally won a well-deserved Oscar for his screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel of the same name. Tally doesn't feel the need to focus on violence and gore, which is one of the movie's strengths. Instead he focuses on the characters, and I'd be lying if I said he didn't flesh them out very, very, very, well.\r\n\r\nJonathan Demme also won an Oscar for his directing and he does a very good job of it.\r\n\r\n_The Silence of the Lambs_ is relentlessly thrilling and it holds me to my seat until the last frame every time I see it, all without relying on excessive gore.\r\nI've already mentioned that _The Silence of the Lambs_ doesn't scare me, so it may - or may not - scare you, depending on what you're afraid of. Admittedly, there are a few creepy things displayed onscreen so I can see why it would scare some viewers.\r\nEither way, I can't recommend _The Silence of the Lambs_ enough, and everybody should see it at least once.\r\n\r\n_The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite of mine, and it holds up very, very well almost 25 years after its release. It's relentlessly thrilling, flawlessly acted, flawlessly written, flawlessly directed, and one of the few movies that actually deserved all the Oscars it won."

The judge gives him another option, which he accepts -- he must live in his rat-infested hell hole until he brings it up to liveable standards. The judge gives him 120 days, during which time Louie meets many of his tenants, including drug dealer Marlon (Ruben Blades). Over time, Louie grows more sympathetic with their problems and sees the results of his own greediness. Unfortunately, Louie's father, Big Lou Kritski (Vincent Gardenia), is the real owner of the property, and he resists his son's entreaties to spend money to clean up the place.",

It could have been so bad, but the film somehow pulls it off with crazy stunts, an amazing cast and a great story. \r\n\r\nThe film really tackles the fate of humanity straight on which gets you thinking about our path as a species but also what we can do today to change things. The story takes you on a journey which is one of the most believable time travel movies of all time.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are fantastic, with wall to wall fighting, car chases and military maneuvers that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's mixed with a great cast and brilliant story telling from the directory. I would say its even better than the first movie which is also a classic.\r\n\r\nOverall I have probably seen this movie 20 or 30 times over the last 25 years(go is it that long!!) and still don't get bored. Its a timeless classic that I urge everyone to watch."

Brad Pitt plays a cowboy drifter while Michael Madsen and Christopher McDonald are on hand as the beau and hubby of the women. \r\n\r\n\"Thelma & Louise\" (1991) is an iconic crime drama/road movie spiced with a few thrills. It\u2019s entertaining, but not really empowering for females, unless making rash, stupid decisions and ruining your life is empowering. It\u2019s amusing, dramatic and scenic, yet ultimately tragic. \r\n\r\nSarandon was 41 during shooting while Davis was ten years younger. Both look great, but their characters are a bit of a turn-off during the opening reel, especially the ditzy Thelma (Davis), yet they win sympathy as the movie progresses.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal and Utah, as well as Bedrock, Colorado.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Klaus Maria Brandauer is alongside him, portraying Alex. Brandauer is the better of the two, but both play big parts in making the film a good one.\r\n\r\nThe plot isn't anything tremendously memorable but it is something I felt entertained by, I never got bored at any point of the 107 minute run time. There's a couple of nice scenes, particularly one with Hawke and Jed the Wolfdog. The locations are shot pretty nicely, too.\r\n\r\nRecommended."

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAladdin is one of Disney\u2018s most adored classics, being the indisputable favorite of many, many fans. The Lion King will always have that spot in my heart, but I also visited this story set in Agrabah dozens of times. Now, with the 2019\u2019s remake about to premiere, I rewatched it last night and, once again, I fell in love. Honestly, I didn\u2019t remember how funny and entertaining it is! It still holds up incredibly well, even though the film was released almost 30 years ago. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it\u2019s the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of Disney\u2018s best.\r\n\r\nAs it\u2019s known, Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography, as his career-best interpretation of an animated character. Genie is one of the most versatile figures of Disney and Williams spreads out his wings of creativeness and imagination, delivering a phenomenal voice performance of the hilarious blue entity. From his seamless imitations to the simple yet extremely difficult tone changes, he gives everything. Genie appears every time the film most needs him, which is when the pacing starts to drop and needs something to pump it back up while moving the plot forward. He could merely be a plot device, but thankfully the writers gave him an unique personality with his own motivations, making us not only laugh with him but genuinely care about his destiny.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the other main attribute of this movie: its writing. The dialogues feel realistic, grounded, and there are no real exposition scenes, besides the musical sequences, which are also meant to serve that purpose. Aladdin and Jasmine lived utterly opposite lives, and both wish to change. Each wants the other\u2019s life experiences and adventures, which provides some amazing moments between these characters. I still wish their relationship had more time to develop (something I hope the remake will do), as well as Jafar\u2018s motivations. It\u2019s 1992, and it\u2019s an animated film, but the cliche villain who wants power because \u201cI\u2019m the bad guy\u201d never quite worked. However, the menacing and dark voice of John Freeman sells this character. In addition to these protagonists, Abu and Iago are two comedy sources that perfectly work, all the time.\r\n\r\nMusically, there is no way of denying the cultural impact that the Aladdin songs had. From Arabian Nights to A Whole New World, every song is filled with rich lyrics, great rhythm, and a beautiful tone. Not only are these able to develop the character or move the plot forward, but they also help the story never to break its fast pacing. Almost 30 years later, the animation quality still looks striking, and there are so many memorable backgrounds and visually outstanding settings. Disney\u2018s 90s decade is an absolute treasure in movie history: Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tarzan, Aladdin and a few more animated diamonds (in the rough) that went a bit under the radar. \r\n\r\nAll of these will definitely get a live-action remake (some already have), and I welcome all of them. Stop trying to boycott something that will only help the new generations to fall in love with the same characters that we did. Live-action isn\u2019t here to offend our childhood or produce cheap copies of our favorite films! It isn\u2019t here to replace the originals but to honor them instead by delivering modern takes on stories that impacted us on a deep emotional level, and that will try to do the same for our children, grandsons and nephews. Are they going to be better than the source material? Worse? It doesn\u2019t really matter as long as they keep the original\u2019s essence and the traits that made us adore these unforgettable characters. And, please, stop the \u201cthey\u2019re doing these remakes for money\u201d argument. That can literally be said about every movie in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, entertainment is a business, it always was, and it always will be. Move on.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Aladdin is a beautifully passionate story about how two incredibly different people with two completely different lifestyles can come to love each other by who they truly are. Robin Williams is a perfectly polished diamond and his scenes alone superbly elevate this film. One of Disney most impactful classics, filled with memorable songs, well-written characters, and stunning animation, which holds up remarkably still to this day. Despite some nitpicks regarding Jafar and the protagonists\u2019 relationship, Aladdin is undoubtedly an unbelievably precious gem which continues (and will continue) to be loved by newer generations all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating: A"

            "review": "Aliens, a great action movie, cheapened the original by replacing one hyper-intelligent, indestructible monster with an army of gormless critters. This third entry has only one creature, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. When Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a prison planet full of hard-nut slap-heads, they haven't seen a woman in years. Discovering that there's an alien loose, Ripley asks the warden to break out the guns, and can't believe it when she is told there aren't any. Nor can we. Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past, but not here. Dance is slaughtered in the first act, as is the regulation bastard warden (Glover), leaving only Sigourney, impressive as ever, and a motley cast of extras. Though wasteful of the expensive sets, Fincher's tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic."

Though it's not mentioned in the interviews of either star or director, the wonderful car chase brought to mind that 'other' car chase Frisco Bay movie, 'Bullitt'. But given the remarkable landscape of the area, why not? One would be a fool not to push the stylistic envelope as far as the censors will allow. A film that would have made The Master of Suspense proud, methinks, and one that he himself perhaps would have done, had Joe Eszterhas' very fun script been around, during, say, the time of 'Frenzy', when Hitchcock was at his cheekiest. A fantastic date movie too, by the way..."

We all know his story now thanks to Hugh Jackman. Some brief nudity and a HOT scene with Winona as she runs though the garden in her PJ's. Not only do I gave Bram Stoker's Dracula 5 stars, BUT I rate it in my Top 10 all-time. MUST SEE!"

The plot sees Woods as con-man Gabriel Caine, recently out of prison he and his cohort Fitz (Platt), set up a boxing \"sting\" in Diggstown, a hickville place out in Olivair County that is run by egomaniac John Gillon (Dern). The set-up entails Caine's old friend Honey Roy Palmer (Gossett Jr) having to fight, and beat, 10 Diggstown men in one day. As the money goes down and secrets come out, corruption and violence is never far away.\r\n\r\nMidnight Sting was one of those film's that came to my attention in the early hours of one morning. I couldn't sleep and turned the TV on out of pure frustration at a lack of sleep. What I didn't know at that time of irksome sleepy annoyance was that I would fall in love with a movie, a love that lasts to this very day. The TV announcer said the name of the movie and that it stars James Woods. Since Woods is always value for money I thought I would give it a go, for the next 98 minutes I laughed out loud, I cringed at some sad moments and I punched the air on more than one occasion. It quickly became one of my favourite movies of all time. On the surface it looks a very simple tale, but it has so much more to offer outside of the excellent fight sequences and some belting one liners. \r\n\r\nBased on Leonard Wise's novel \"The Diggstown Ringers\", the film deals in loyalties, friendships, greed, power, corruption and lies - not to mention small town mentality being under the microscope. It's impeccably acted as well, with the Woods and Gossett play off one of the most engaging duets of the 1990s. The twists within, and there are some corkers, really crown what was already a smart and witty script. It was a film that went largely unnoticed upon its release, and even now in this age of rampant internet usage it appears to still be under seen or sadly forgotten. It of course will not become a personal favourite of all newcomers to it, but just maybe one day if you can't sleep or you are stuck for a rental then you should give it a chance. Because it deserves a chance to at least try to welcome you into its fan club. \r\n\r\nI love it, you know that by now, and there's a chance that you will too. Punch the air brilliant. 10/10"

Perhaps this is why he\u2019s assigned to defending two young Marines stationed at Guantanamo Bay who are accused of murdering a fellow Marine. They maintain that they were ordered to enact a \u201cCode Red,\u201d which took an unforeseen turn. Demi Moore and Kevin Pollak co-star as the lawyer\u2019s partners while Kevin Bacon heads the prosecution and Jack Nicholson plays the arrogant commanding officer of Guantanamo. J.T. Walsh is on hand as the Colonel\u2019s weak subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe movie does a good job of depicting the honor code of hardcore Marines, particularly in the sequence where Lance Cpl. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) refuses to confess to something he didn\u2019t do in order to get a minor sentence. The characters are well written and casted, e.g. Kaffee (Cruise) and his penchant for baseball. The story is dialog-driven and maintains your attention without action/thrills.\r\n\r\nNicholson is commanding and intimidating as the pompous colonel. Kaffee discovers his talent as a courtroom lawyer and realizes that the only way to take him down is to use his egotism against him. Other than the cringe-inducing \u201cA Ten Hut\u201d scene at the end, this is a gripping drama.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot entirely in Southern Cal (Point Mugu, Crystal Cove, etc.) and Washington DC. WRITERS: Aaron Sorkin (play) and Aaron Sorkin (screenplay).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Ernie Hudson plays a mentally challenged laborer while Julianne Moore is on hand as the wife\u2019s best friend.   \r\n\r\n\"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle\" (1992) is a drama/thriller in the mold of contemporary flicks like \u201cThe Stepfather\u201d (1987) and \u201cThe Crush\u201d (1993). The events even take place in the same area as those. While it\u2019s the least of these, it\u2019s not far off in overall quality. \r\n\r\nIt has a bit of a Lifetime movie vibe and the serviceable Sciorra doesn\u2019t trip my trigger while De Mornay\u2019s character is a turn-off because she\u2019s obviously nutzoid. Meanwhile Moore superbly plays a biyatch while McCoy is ineffectual as the hubby. The locations are fabulous, however. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Seattle, Tacoma and Issaquah, Washington.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

As such, events do drag out towards the end. However, I did find myself enjoying it, albeit on a minor level. There are a few amusing moments, while it does create some interesting shenanigans with the big kid.\r\n\r\nRick Moranis is the only cast member worth talking about, he doesn't give an incredible performance or anything close but remains - just like in the 1989 production - the best part of the film.\r\n\r\nI expected it to be terrible, it's actually alright - not one to be taken at all seriously, it's purely childish. I'm sure the younger audience will find enjoyment in it."

It stars Andy Garcia, Uma Thurman, John Malkovich, Lance Henriksen, Kathy Baker and Graham Beckel. Music is by Christopher Young and cinematography by Conrad Hall.\r\n\r\nThe small town of Eureka and John Berlin (Garcia) is the new cop in the precinct. When a severed hand is found at the local dump it leads Berlin to believe a serial killer is at work. One who has a penchant for blind girls.\r\n\r\nThe problems quickly mounted up for Jennifer 8, it flopped big in America and went straight to home format release in the UK. Problems back stage got so bad that Bruce Robinson quit Hollywood and never made another film for 19 years! In spite of these facts, it\u2019s not the monstrosity it was originally painted as back on its \u201climited\u201d release.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a frustrating film in many ways because it promises so much. There\u2019s bags of moody atmospherics wrung out by Conrad Hall\u2019s superb photography, where he filters most things via minimal lighting. Much of the play unfolds in ominous surroundings, where dialogue exchanges are either hushed or laced with harried fervour, and the writing is actually quite smart as it blends psycho thriller staples with strong characterisations that are in turn boosted by committed acting performances. Yet these things can\u2019t compensate for the too long run time, a rushed ending and some awkward tonal shifts that often take you out of the required mood. The rushed ending is particularly galling, after asking the audience to stay with the pic for two hours, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect a good long and dramatic finale, sadly that\u2019s not the case.\r\n\r\nFans of neo-noir type visuals have some interest here, as does anyone who likes the type of serial killer movies that dominated the late 80s and early 90s before Fincher\u2019s Seven raised the bar. 6/10"

            "review": "Death and honour are thought to be the same, but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.\r\n\r\nThe Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann who also co-adapts the screenplay with Christopher Crowe from James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Steven Waddington and Wes Studi. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.\r\n\r\n1757 during the French and Indian War, Hawkeye (Lewis), a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans, finds himself on a perilous journey to escort a couple of British sisters to their father's fort. This journey brings him, and his companions, into conflict with Magua (Studi), a sadistic Huron warrior seeking revenge on the girls' father.\r\n\r\nInspired by the Randolph Scott film of the same name made in 1936, Michael Mann gives his all to create a stirring classical epic fit to sit in the company of the historical greats of old. Visually it's a treat of some magnitude, where aided by Spinotti, Mann frames his characters in the glorious vistas provided by the North Carolinas. For those with a bent for historical narratives, Mann's film also is not found wanting, in fact it's a cerebral delight. There's romantic strands that sit right in the colourful quilt, action expertly staged and handled by the talented director and the cast, led by a superbly athletic and serious Day-Lewis, are impressive and doing justice to the requisite characters written on the page, and the musical score enhances mood with swirling beauty coupling with primitive potency that wraps itself snugly around the story.\r\n\r\nMann gets all the key ingredients right, but it's his ability to balance the human drama with the energised action that is most impressive. The film is also thankfully devoid of boorish filler, this is a troubled time in history, with much political activity and complex racial manoeuvres, but Mann doesn't need to fill the screen with political posturing and drawn out speeches. We know all we need to know about the period in question, but the story is kept intimate, the focus on a small group of people, of whose fate we most assuredly have interest in. While on the edges of the frame we know we are witnessing the death of an era, for better or worse on different sides of the coin. Also pays to note that Mann's well known penchant for the meticulous is evident as well, for he details the native characters with considerable care.\r\n\r\nIt's not flawless, accents fluctuate, the odd fake look slips into the production design and the director does what many American directors do, they come dangerously close to caricaturing their British officers, but this is still great heroic escapism tinged with romanticism. Something for everyone who loves classical cinema in fact. 9/10"

It stars Pierce Brosnan, Jeff Fahey, Jenny Wright, Geoffrey Lewis, Jeremy Slate and Dean Norris. Music is by Dan Wyman and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDr. Lawrence Angelo (Brosnan) is a big mover in the science of virtual reality. When he tries his new technology  on mentally challenged gardener Jobe Smith (Fahey), it elevates him to a higher intelligence and it\u2019s not long before Jobe acquires scary new powers\u2026\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOriginally meant to be, and titled as, Stephen King\u2019s Lawnmower Man, the film eventually, after a King lawsuit, ended up bearing very little resemblance to the author\u2019s short story. There\u2019s a couple of small ligaments that link the two, but in the main (not Maine) this Lawnmower Man is its own entity and an obvious attempt to cash in on the then virtual reality zeitgeist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLawnmower Man has a cult fan base, of that there is no doubt, where much like Tron from 10 years earlier, the effects work and the capturing of something very much being \u201cin\u201d with the youth of the time,  has proved perpetually appealing to nostalgists. But strip away these and you have your basic Frankenstein story for the 90s, a pretty standard story lacking intelligent smarts or deep thematic points of worth. And then of course there is the bizarre fact of having a film decrying the advancement of computer technology, by using computer technology to make the film\u2019s strongest moments! Hee. It\u2019s only adequately performed by the cast, and Leonard\u2019s direction matches his writing, which is mundane when not about the visual effects; effects work that dated very quickly as it happened.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOther cuts and sequels would follow, the former didn\u2019t improve the same basic problems of the theatrical cut, the latter releases proved to be laughably bad. The Lawnmower Man, an interesting movie in the context of its time, and certainly fun enough for those who were there cloaked in a visually inspired warm glow, but it has not been a must see film for anyone else since 1995. 4/10"

Enter the ladies who themselves help to kick start a womens league to keep the Baseball fires burning.\r\n\r\nThe first thing any prospective first time viewer of this piece should note, is that it's not actually a film about Baseball. It's about friendships, challenges and differing off shoots to the complications of war, it just so happens that it's the game of Baseball that brings it all together! \r\n\r\nDirected by Penny Marshall (Big), screenplay by Lowell Ganz & Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers/Parenthood) and featuring Tom Hanks (wonderful as drunken coach Dugan) as the leading male, it's no surprise that \"A League Of Their Own\" booms with sentiment and no little amount of comedy. It is to me a very rewarding picture, the sort that wants you to chuckle along with it whilst noting the need for human interaction during a troubled time. \r\n\r\nThe lady actors do great impressions of bona fide athletes, asked to parade in short skirts and entertain the watching public, these gals, led by the always engaging Geena Davis, deliver a sparky picture that never veers into maudlin territory. There are of course some sombre moments, but they are placed nicely by Marshall in the context of the films' events, never trite, they serve more as tender vignettes to run alongside the frivolity on offer.\r\n\r\n Ultimately \"A League Of Their Own\" has achieved its aims come the final credits, its not taxing and its not purporting to be an intelligent look at a period in history. It's asking us the viewers to feel heartened by what we just watched, and just maybe to give those girls back in the 1940s a piece of our respect, job done. 7/10"

            "review": "The public get what they want.\r\n\r\nIn this third instalment of the popular Lethal Weapon series, Murtaugh is counting down the days till he finally hangs up his badge, but he and Riggs run into an ex-cop who is dealing in special cop-killing bullets.\r\n\r\nIn total there were four Lethal Weapon films, regardless of quality (they declined in quality with each release) each film made gargantuan amounts of money. Who could blame those involved for milking it for all it was worth if the paying public demanded it eh? Made for $35 million, part 3 went on to make Worldwide $321 million, thus ensuring that a part 4 was inevitable. But is Lethal Weapon 3 actually any good? Was the loyal paying public rewarded for their time?.\r\n\r\nWell yes, chances are that if you were already a fan of the series then this does deliver all you wanted and hoped for. Director Richard Donner and his team of writers shrewdly cottoned on to the basic fact that the ante had to be raised. It's a pretty light plot in truth, but enter more explosions, more action and make Riggs more comically reckless than usual, well it's a successful formula - even if Riggs and Murtaugh are now in essence just a comedy double act (one man love sequence not withstanding that is). Into the mix comes karate-kicking Internal Affairs female sergeant Lorna Cole (a more than agreeable turn from Rene Russo), who simultaneously gives Riggs more scope for gags and a love interest, and love him or hate him, Joe Pesci again pops in with mirth as the whiny Leo Getz. Stuart Wilson gets to play the bad guy with relish, and just to show it's not all about slam bangery and japes, the film also boasts having an affecting strand about kids with guns on the streets - and of course the scum who put those guns into those hands.\r\n\r\nIt's all very simple and disposable in the world of the popcorn actioner, and yeah, it's not as good as what came before it in the series, but it's still an entertaining viewing for the series fans regardless. 7/10"

Satisfying sports story, a solid message, decent humour and a serviceable cast.\r\n\r\nEmilio Estevez is fine in the role of Gordon, he's definitely the best actor on display here. The numerous child actors are all alright, Shaun Weiss (Goldberg) is the one who stands out in my memory most.\r\n\r\nA nice little film about a local, youth ice hockey team, one for the family."

Two youths from New York are wrongly accused of murder while traveling through Alabama and one of them (Ralph Macchio) calls on his inexperienced lawyer cousin, Vinny (Joe Pesci), to defend them. Vinny roles into town with his hot fianc\u00e9 (Marisa Tomei) intent on winning his first big case.\r\n\r\nI've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but never got around to seeing it till the other night and was pleasantly surprised. It's part fish-out-of-water comedy and part courtroom drama. The hulking Fred Gwynne plays the staunch judge, an amusing performance. It was Gwynne's last film.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with laughs throughout, but it's more than just a goofball comedy. At some point early in the second act I strangely found myself liking Vinny and wanting him to succeed. I also found myself warming up to Vinny & his fianc\u00e9 as a couple. They're an odd couple, but somehow click. I guess this is where Marisa got the reputation for liking short, stocky men.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Marisa, she's just stunning here, although I prefer her more as she gets older, e.g. 2008's \"The Wrestler.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in Georgia and runs 120 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Terrorist is transported by FBI on commercial flight, terrorist escapes with the help of an insider on the plane, our hero gets arrested by bungling cops who mistakes him for a bad guy and of course the obligatory jump off or on the plane while it is moving scenes. Yawn!\r\n\r\nWesley Snipes performance is as good as one can expect of Wesley Snipes which of course does not help elevate the movie above mediocrity. The one character which stands above the rest is the master terrorist played by Bruce Payne. I quite liked his cool, insane style of portraying his character.\r\n\r\nThere are a few semi-decent action scenes splattered around the movie which helps keeping the interest just above the I\u2019ll-read-a-book-instead level. Otherwise the movie is an easily forgettable one. It is quite acceptable as 85 minutes of light entertainment but I would say that its relatively short length is one of its positive traits."

However, the action set pieces make their mark and thankfully we get a riveting final reel that cements the entertainment deal for time spent with the pic. \r\n\r\nIt is formulaic to a degree, but that is OK if the combined efforts of all involved are spot on, and thankfully here they are. 7/10"

Barry in essentially the same role (though now even more overtly crooked and with the FBI) and swap out that Thai drug baron John Lone visited with Tzi Ma and  now throw in Bruce Lee's son into the mix. Bring in horror director Dwight H. Little (fresh off his other successful action outing **MARKED FOR DEATH**) and see what we get?\r\n\r\nWell, the results are a bit of a mixed bag for sure. While the action sequences are largely okay, the plot doesn't really throw us any surprises. The romance between Brandon and a female police officer falls flat on its face and the surrogate father-son dynamic he has with grizzled cop Powers Boothe feels similarly forced and awkward. Also, why is a big Chinese drug shipment being brought in via the Port of Chicago when anywhere on the West Coast would be 1000x more convenient? Plot contrivances galore, plus a really goofy Tienamen Square flashback make for just a little too much dumb writing to take seriously.\r\n\r\nThat said, Brandon Lee, though still a bit rough around the edges, is tremendously charismatic as the lead. His character seems very much a humanized fish out of water and his handling of the numerous martial arts sequences makes us lament his untimely passing that much more. Dwight's action highlights come near the start with a very John Woo inspired shootout in an art gallery and reach their crescendo mid-movie with a hapless gang of Italian wannabe mobsters turning their besieged restaurant HQ into a fortress. \r\n\r\nNick Mancuso, the primary antagonist of the picture, really shines as a somehow likable pathetic wimp of a mob boss. He's a lot of fun to watch, and its unfortunate that his character leaves the film prior to the third act, which turns into a straight-up dig on John Woo with a very low-stakes cliched battle in a Chinese... laundromat / factory (???). Both Tzi Ma and Al Leong get in some quality martial arts time with Brandon, but it's still so much more fun to see him in a fisticuffs match with giant brute Tony Longo in that mid-movie restaurant scene.\r\n\r\nAs it is, **Rapid Fire** has a lot of fun 80's/early-90's-style action in it and sits comfortably next to the likes of **RAW DEAL** and **HARD TO KILL** in terms of quality. Had it not been saddled with a lame script that plays its cards way too soon, it could have been a lot more. Leave it to Brandon's final film **THE CROW** to finally deliver the action goods to end up defining one of Hollywood's most tragically brief and promising careers."

I greatly thank Harvey Keitel for taking a chance on Tarantino back then--It paid off in spades."

She ends up with a friendly identical twin that lost her sister when she was a girl (Jennifer Jason Leigh). A quality friendship develops until dubious things start happening.    \r\n\r\n\"Single White Female\" (1992) mixes elements of \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d (1987) with the setting of \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d (1968). It\u2019s not great like the former, but it\u2019s on par with the latter and arguably superior. The film possesses a haunting ambiance, which is assisted by the venue, but this same attribute eventually hinders the movie by making it one-dimensional. \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d had the same problem. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the two stars regularly appear in various stages of undress is titillating, yet it can\u2019t make up for the one-note tone and locale. Still, the movie\u2019s entertaining enough and I would\u2019ve given it a better grade, but the third act is overlong and curiously tedious despite the slasher thrills. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot at Ansonia Hotel, Manhattan, and Raleigh Studios, Hollywood. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

Like Clarence Williams III from The Mod Squad?\r\n\r\nWhen a worldly singer witnesses a mob crime, the police hide her as a nun in a traditional convent where she has trouble fitting in.\r\n\r\nWhoopi Goldberg is the sister act of the title, and boy does she have a great time with the characterisation. It's hardly pulling up any trees, and it holds few surprises, yet it's so warm and gentle with its humour it's near impossible to dislike.\r\n\r\nThe laughs obviously come from Goldberg's street wise gal trying to adapt to life in a convent. The big message that unfolds, as she gets more at ease with her surroundings, is that not only can earthy girls come to be honourable by learning new fortitudes, but also that they can positively affect those around them in a perceived stuffy environment.\r\n\r\nThe trajectory of the nunnery choir under Goldberg's tutorship - from wailing cats to cherubic angels - is the film's highlights, while Maggie Smith as the prim and proper Mother Superior is class unbound. Harvey  Keitel as the gangster who is after our sister's blood is wasted, and the ending is never really in doubt, yet this is a good pick me up movie, undemanding fun for those after a quick smiley fix. 7/10"

            "review": "We are not chasing it, it's chasing us.\r\n\r\nSplit Second is directed by Tony Maylam and Ian Sharp and written by Gary Scott Thompson. It stars Rutger Hauer, Kim Cattrall and Neil Duncan. It was filmed in London, England, predominantly at the Hartley Jam Factory in Southwark, with Clive Tickner the cinematographer.\r\n\r\nLondon, 2008. \r\n\r\n\"After forty days and nights of torrential rain, the city is largely submerged below water, a result of the devastating effects of continued global warming. The warnings ignored for decades have now resulted in undreamed of levels of pollution where day has become almost endless night...\" \r\n\r\nand something is stalking the watery city and tearing hearts out of its victims...\r\n\r\nPlot follows a familiar course, and in truth there's no surprises here. A psychic link between Stone and the killer is sadly never fully formed, which is a shame because it had the potential to make the film more interesting. To offset that though, is that there is some nice babble involving astrological and satanic matters which are thrown up during the search/investigation. In its favour as well, is that Maylam and his team sensibly keep the perpetrator hidden for most of the film, instead choosing the odd flashing glimpse of a clawed hand, or a murky torso running across the frame, while the idea to only show the bloody aftermath of a kill hits home harder than if we had actually viewed it.\r\n\r\nThe look is spot on for an apocalyptic sci-fi piece, all greys, silvers and low lights, while the cheap production design works well in context of the tone of the picture. There's even some Schwarzenegger like cheese dialogue, the likes of which the big Austrian would have got paid millions to speak at around the same time Split Second was released. The killer, once revealed, will disappoint many, mainly because it looks overly familiar, but it does impact for the finale set at a flooded tube station. While the music (co-scored by three different people) is ideal as it sounds very tinny, in fact it's very 1980's like.\r\n\r\nJudging by the critical reaction to it you have to think some folk were taking it a bit too seriously. Never fully convincing as a lead man, Hauer pitches this just right, with tongue in cheek, a grizzled personage and a swagger to match the glint in is eyes. He's playing a burned out cop character called Harley Stone, his partner, who of course is the polar opposite, is named Dick Durkin! Take this seriously? Never! Cattrall is merely here to be a love interest, to scream and show some flesh for the discerning hound dog, while her haircut, some black dyed German Helmet effort, is totally unflattering. Duncan does a fine job as the nerdy copper, working the comedy off of Hauer very well, while fleeting support comes from great British actors Alun Armstrong and Pete Postlethwaite. In cameos we get song man Ian Dury and Michael J. Pollard.\r\n\r\nLeave the brain at the door and you have a good chance of enjoying this low-budget British sci-fier. 7/10"

It won loads of Oscars and other film awards in 1993, but it still should have won more. \r\nTalk about a man at his peak ? This has Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris, Morgan Freeman and virtual rookie, Jaimz Woolvett as The Schofield Kid, all putting in magnificent, career defining performances. Not to mention the bit players who all add to this stunningly captivating film.\r\n\r\nWeak points ? There are none. Every frame is a gem. It has plenty of dark humour. A few touching moments where you would think it wasn't possible. Sadistic and brutal fight scenes and then it has Clint Eastwood riding into town for the final terrifying, yet totally satisfying, showdown.\r\n \r\nHow Al Pacino (The Scent of a Woman) beat Clint to Best Actor in 1993 is a mystery of modern times. Right up there with how The Shawshank Redemption didn't win anything of note in '95 but is now regarded as possibly the greatest film of all time by many people."

The main reason for that is Elijah Wood, who is honestly tremendous in the role of Huckleberry Finn. I've only, as of recently, seen Wood in his adult years, this is the best performance I've seen from him; I'm yet to watch <em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em>, admittedly.\r\n\r\nAway from Wood, there are a few other strong cast members. Courtney B. Vance is impressive as Jim, while Jason Robards (The King) and Robbie Coltrane (The Duke) are a good double act. I very much like the cast.\r\n\r\nOnto the story. It's kinda bonkers. It goes from being sombre, to being funny, to being serious, back to sombre, back to funny etc. It's very up and down in that sense, the first and third acts are rather heavy but the middle act is as silly as it could possibly be really. It has a very mixed feel about it, amidst the overall arc of slavery.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely a positive message in there, particularly with Finn and Jim. It's just muddled in with comedy, somewhat oddly. All that matters, though, is did I feel entertained by it? Yes, quite easily so. A film to watch, certainly.\r\n\r\nWorth noting I am the opposite of book smart (aim to change that at some point!), despite knowing the name of the title character I've never read the book by Mark Twain. Therefore I couldn't tell you if it does Twain's work justice, or how it relates to it."

            "review": "My name is Ash and I am a slave. Close as I can figure, the year is thirteen hundred A.D and I'm being dragged to my death.\r\n\r\nArmy of Darkness is directed by Sam Raimi and Raimi co-writes the screenplay with his brother Ivan. It stars Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert, Ian Abercrombie, Richard Grove and Timothy Patrick Quill. Music is by Joseph LoDuca and cinematography by Bill Pope. \r\n\r\nAsh (Campbell) is transported to 1300 A.D., where he must battle an army of the dead and retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home. \r\n\r\nUnofficially it's Evil Dead III, but as the fans will atest, this is a very different animal to the two films that preceeded it. Blending high energy jinks in medieval times with comedy horror staples, it's a riotous idea that mostly works. Of course one has to accept it on its riotous terms, this for sure isn't a pic for the highbrow crowd. Though it should at least be given the chance to brighten a dark day.\r\n\r\nCampell as Ash is put through the mangler once again, with some nifty physical comedy nestling nicely with that of Ash's anachronistic verbalities. It's all breakneck stuff that's performed with a wonderfully self mocking attitude that's easy to warm to. It's a comic book brought to life and it never sags, but some of the cartoon sequence beasties sadly do look a little flat.\r\n\r\nGreat fun if prepared for what type of pic it is, it's not hard to see why it is so beloved in Evil Dead fan circles. 7/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: There are alterante ending versions, of which I have only seen the downbeat time potion one - but being the miserable sod that I am, I love this ending."

After his self imposed break he returns in the hope of rekindling a relationship with Jessie (Janine Turner). Whilst at the rescue centre he is called to help a group who are stranded in the mountains, he agrees to help out this one last time, unaware that the group in the mountains are heavily armed murderous thieves and they need help of another kind...\r\n\r\nDirected by Renny Harlin, this is one of those films that shows that Stallone once had box office clout as big as his bodily frame. It's a delightful no brain action film that delivers royally to those with a bent for the action genre. What really lifts Clifhanger above average is the wonderful use of suspenseful situations. The film opens with a quite breath taking sequence and then kicks on to literally have us hanging on by our fingernails. The bad guys are deliciously over the top, none more so than the bullishly nasty John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, whilst Sly gets beefcake support from the ever reliable Michael Rooker. Cinematography by Alex Thomson is gorgeous as he brings to life the Cortina d'Ampezzo area of the Dolomites in Italy. Score is by Trevor Jones, who keeps it orchestral as he lifts from his own work for Last of the Mohicans, which in turn is mixed with what sounds like the lead theme of Alan Silvestri's work on Predator.\r\n\r\nSlam bang action, tense fraught moments, and a script written with knowing tongue in cheek persuasion, Cliffhanger literally does ROCK. 7.5/10"

For some reason it was playing at a dingy burlesque-haunted cinema on old Granville Street in Vancouver on a Sunday afternoon in 1993 where wasted men usually shuffle in to deposit their sperm. (Not enough credit goes to internet porn for cleaning up the streets). Richard Linkater wasn't a story at the time. The guy who made Slackers. The bastard love child of Jim Jarmusch and Chrissie Hynde for all I knew. No clue he'd be the chosen one to eventually deliver us to _Boyhood_. I went in with a friend on a lark and floated out on a psilocybin cloud of joy. I was awestruck. I know these guys! I wanted to endlessly sing its praises but my friend didn't get the same charge out of it. (Although months later at a Christmas party of wayward misfits, he couldn't stop playing the sound track). Maybe it was me. But this was exactly how I remembered High School in the 70's. Was I hallucinating the whole thing? Indeed I was stoned much of the time, but all that was brilliantly accounted for. All that was missing was a bit of Pink Floyd and a whole lot of Led Zeppelin as alluded to in the title. _Dazed & Confused_ isn't merely the best movie about High School in the 1970's. It is the best movie about High School, and the best movie about the 1970's, and perhaps the best movie about male adolescence (yes, yes, IMHO, of course, what else). I dare not watch it again for what if I burst the bubble of such virgin memories to forever spoil my love and admiration for it. Or was it the dingy cinema I have fond nostalgic feelings for? Something. I'll have to watch it again, probably soon, once Linklater finally gets the grand red-carpet treatment along with the golden trinkets he so long deserves."

The old man is a jerk too, but it is largely reactionary.\r\n\r\nI can't even remember the inevitable heart-warming resolution of the child lying to the old man at the end of the movie right before he does it again.  It's like watching a serial killer documentary: this is a sociopathic character, and I'm glad we don't have modern day versions of this, at least not that I can see."

            "review": "A celebration of the inimitable Bruce Lee and what he represented\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Rob Cohen, \" Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\" stars Jason Scott Lee as the martial arts superstar, tracing his early life in Hong Kong to his fresh start in the San Francisco area where he starts a martial arts school, meets his babe (Lauren Holly) and moves on to TV and Film. He must boldly face many enemies along the way, including his childhood demon. \r\n\r\nThis is basically a rags-to-riches flick and ranks with my favorite films due to its excellent meshing of dynamism, fun and potent drama. I haven\u2019t seen too many martial arts flicks, but \u201cDragon\u201d is easily the all-around best of those I\u2019ve seen. It mixes real-life with Hollywood mythmaking, which is what many cinematic biographies do, e.g. \"Buffalo Bill\" (1944) and \"Braveheart\" (1995). In these types of movies the gist of the story is true, but it's mixed with numerous fictional or even fantastical elements to make the protagonist a larger-than-life hero, but also to entertain the audience because real-life is always more mundane and therefore dull. And movies are made primarily to make money through entertaining, not to relay the truth in exact detail. \r\n\r\nRight from the get-go the film telegraphs that it's a mythmaking account when Bruce takes on the arrogant British sailors at a dance. He throws one of them and the sailor topples 3-4 other men accompanied by the sound of a bowling ball striking pins (lol). While this particular episode never happened, occasions LIKE IT did, even if it was to someone other than Bruce. The same is true with other sequences, like the fight in the gym, which never happened. But, again, events LIKE IT have.   \r\n\r\nThe movie is really meant as a celebration of Bruce Lee, his phenomenal expertise in martial arts and the genre he made popular. If you're looking for an actual biography of his life check out the two biographies listed below (under \u201cWRITERS\u201d). \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, \u201cDragon\u201d was partially based on the autobiography of Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce\u2019s wife). Someone offered that she couldn\u2019t possibly have been happy with the film since so much of it is fiction (for instance, Bruce didn\u2019t injure his back as depicted, but via lifting weights). Actually, she was happy with the final picture. But why did she allow so many things to be embellished? Simple: Because the embellishing fed into the Bruce Lee legend from which she benefits.\r\n\r\nIn any case, there are a lot of martial arts thrills mixed with the drama with an exciting action scene occurring roughly every ten minutes. The film gives the protagonist & a few others power over time and space. Of course, one cannot do in real life many of the things these characters perform due to the restrictions imposed by Newton's Laws but, hey, it\u2019s entertaining. This factor explains why \u201cDragon\u201d has been criticized for springing from one thing to the next too quickly, never pausing long enough for any strong emotion to resonate or for us to feel we really know the man beyond his proverbs. I disagree; I sensed strong emotion on several occasions, like when Bruce exclaims to Linda: \u201cYou make be believe I can do anything\u201d or when he wildly screams at her to leave his hospital room, not to mention his outstanding meltdown later in Hong Kong (I\u2019ve had a few of those in my life, so I know).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Linda, Lauren Holly is just mind-blowing in her physical prime.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours and was shot in California (San Francisco, Los Angeles & Valencia), China (Macau) and Hong Kong. WRITERS: Three screenwriters wrote the script based on the biographies by Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew) and Robert Clouse (Bruce Lee: The Biography).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

Its not really a tale of urban reality more that the everyday annoyances that we do nothing about and this guy turns them into a personal insult. Its starts normally enough, stuck in traffic, beep noises and drilling on a hot day, his AC is broken, the window is broken. Instead of just shrugging it off with that Monday feeling he just abandons his car and goes for a walk, to start with its a shop owner with overpriced drinks that gets his shop smashed up a bit, later only when threatened with violence himself does he defend himself against 2 gang members. This is where things start to suddenly go weird, the gang members drive round and stumble across him somehow, (I'm British but I think LA is a little too big for that) then spray bullets in a drive by 20ft away and miss him completely but hit everyone around him and then they promptly crash. He walks over to the car, collects a bag of guns from it then goes and shoots up a burger bar because they are not serving breakfast, which he then changes his mind to lunch anyway and it continues from there. I don't know if this was meant to show some sort of mental brakedown due to his previous life choices but his empathy just disappears. At the start you could relate to the character but the more you watch the more you begin to distance yourself from that notion until you realise you just watched a movie where a guy went round killing people for no reason other than anger at himself for destroying his family life. It leaves me wondering if that was the directors intention or a happy coincidence to push that prospective on the viewer."

He and his wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) are ecstatic in their affluent new world until clues mount up that the firm has a sinister side. Gene Hackman plays his mentor at the firm while Ed Harris appears as an FBI agent. Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn and Gary Busey are also on hand.\r\n\r\nThis has long been one of my favorites from this genre. You really feel for McDeere (Cruise) & his wife as their utopia morphs into an inescapable hell. In the Washington DC scene you grasp how limited their choices are as they\u2019re caught in a crossfire between the Mob and the FBI. McDeere must use his wits, his knowledge and \u201cgolden connections\u201d for them to get out unscathed, if possible. \r\n\r\nI always favored the piano score by Dave Grusin, which some have described as \u201cbouncy.\u201d While you could call it that, it has different tones depending on the sequence. For instance, during the closing city chase it\u2019s driving and portentous. There\u2019s also a melancholic component when suitable. The positive side of the piano score is that it makes the film timeless. Consider quality movies from that general era which were horribly dated by conventional scores, like \u201cNo Way Out\u201d (1987).        \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Memphis, Tennessee; West Memphis, Arkansas; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A/A-"

As he pursues the one-armed killer & those who pulled his strings, a determined U.S. Marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) hunts Kimble down from wilderness regions to the streets of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe first 40 minutes contain the most action, hooking the viewer with an exhilarating bus wreck/train wreck followed by a phenomenal dam sequence. The rest of the movie is an intelligent and suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase with Kimble zeroing-in on those who framed him and why.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fugitive\u201d was a deserved box office hit, costing $40 million and raking in $369 million with $184 of that domestically. To realize just how well-done it is, check out the sequel, \u201cU.S. Marshals\u201d (1998), which features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Illinois and North Carolina; the dam sequence, for instance, was filmed at Cheoah Dam, Tapoco, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

            "review": "I first watched this movie in a movie theater shortly after it came out. It only had a limited release, so most people saw it as a cable release movie.  From the opening title crawl and showing the lead actors in their roles juxtaposed with pictures of the actual historical figures, it had me hook.\r\n\r\nIt is based on the novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. It is one of the first books on the Civil War I read, based on a recommendation by a coworker. I have read dozens and dozens of books on the topic since then, and it is still one of my favorites. Considering that it is a fairly short book, the fact that the movie is over four hours long tells you that a lot more research was done.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t speak to how the actors did with the various southern accents, but I thought it was a strong cast, right down to the lesser roles. I have heard they utilized Civil War re-enactors in the filming, a good source of extras who were familiar with the time period and brought their own period clothing!\r\n\r\nOf course it didn\u2019t hurt my feelings that one of the leads: Jeff Daniels, plays Joshua Chamberlain, who hails from my home state of Maine and who lived a remarkable life: college professor, Volunteer army lieutenant who rose to become a general and Medal of Honor recipient, Governor of Maine - and more. Apparently, thanks to this movie, the most popular spot for tourists at the Gettysburg National Battlefield is where the 20th Maine and Chamberlain fought. As a side note, another offshoot of the story behind Chamberlain and the 20th Maine\u2019s exploits is the song Dixieland by Steve Earle. Whenever I hear the song I want to watch the movie, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nAnyway, of course it is a war movie, and I do not normally like war flicks, but this one is much more than that. You can pretend it is a mini-series and watch it in two or three sittings if that makes it easier. Some people say it lets the southerners off the hook politically, but there is a speech about race relations by Chamberlain that addresses the race issue, I believe, and provides balance.\r\n\r\nWell, I could go on and on, but I will spare you. Besides, there is this song I have a hankering to listen to right now."

Here production company Toho bring back Mechagodzilla, Rodan and sadly - they birth Baby Godzilla. Plot is nutty of course, top level government organisation want rid of Godzilla, so using various mechanics and creature science from previous Godzilla foes, construct a new Mechagodzilla, who is soon to be souped up to be Super Mechagodzilla. Carnage, telepathy, hidden brains and maternal instincts do follow.\r\n\r\nIt's actually one of the better films from the Heisei wave. Standard city destruction via model work is always good fun, but it's nice to find the effects work is of a much better standard than from previous instalments. The action sequences are smartly constructed by Takao Okawara, with the crowning smack-down between Zilla and Metalzilla absolutely joyous, a fun packed blend of cartoonish chaos and death ray destruction. Akira Ifukube once again provides an outstanding musical score, and while you will search long and hard for acting performances of note, it all just falls into place in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nNow if only we didn't have that goddamn Baby Godzilla! So cute! So annoying... 7/10"

            "review": "I imagine most of the love for Hocus Pocus comes from people who re-watch it with nostalgia goggles. Even as a child of the 90's I had never seen Hocus Pocus and knew little of it, so I had no prior attachments to this film. If you have seen any of the Disney Channels terrible made for TV movies, Hocus Pocus is like a particularly bad one with some questionable language and sexual innuendo. The acting is really bad from the entire cast, which is a little surprising considering the witches (who I had always assumed you the heroes of the story, but are clearly not) are two D-List actresses (Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy) and a C-lister (Sarah Jessica Parker) who aren't exactly known for their acting abilities, but are actual professional actresses. The CG effects are bad, even considering this is a 1993 movie and the practical effects aren't even an honest effort. All of this could be forgiven if it was part of a fun, campy family movie, but Hocus Pocus can't even pull that off. The plot is lame and full of inconsistencies and just unreasonably unrealistic moments. The witches have been \"dead\" for 300 years, but will be brought back if a virgin lights the black flame candle. In 1990 a high school boy says multiple times publicly that he is a virgin. Let me just say that again, they think a high school boy would go around announcing himself to be a virgin repeatedly to his peers. This is a public high school in Massachusetts in the 90's, not a Mormon town or a private Catholic school. When the witches return, they have been gone for 300 years and don't even know what the paved road is, thinking it to be a river or what a bus is; they have no knowledge of any of the advances since the 1600's. Having established this, one of the witches flies up to the side of a car on their broom and asks him for his license and registration. So, they don't understand asphalt, but they know motorist jokes? The movie is littered with inconsistencies and a wild lack of understanding of how teenagers and children think and act. Even the three witches can't maintain a consistent character. Bette Midler is supposed to be the smart older sister, but she acts the most irrationally and whines like a child. Sarah Jessica Parker is a horny dumb blonde and Kathy Najimy is a mentally challenged woman who barks an talks out of the side of her mouth, but they are always the ones to reason and plan. Najimy is the worst, with her constantly swinging from offensively stupid the brains of the operation. This was an actual movie released in theaters. Had it been a cheap Disney Channel original, it would still be terrible, but excusable. As a real theatrical film, Hocus Pocus is embarrassing. Unless you grew up with this film, I can't imagine you getting much out of this. It's fairly unoffensive children's drivel, with some questionable language if that's all you need, but it's not a good film. It wasn't fun or interesting and it was probably best left in '93."

Only thing that can be fair in this world is your **HEART** !!\r\n\r\nThough **Daniel Day Lewis'** character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming!\r\n\r\nIt just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!!\r\n\r\nIn all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this..\r\n\r\nWell directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !!\r\n\r\nThose who found it beautiful can go for Hillary Swank's 2010 movie **Conviction** as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !"

It could've worked better as a comedy. Anyway, while viewing I was expecting/hoping for a moment of true drama that would set things alight, but it just waltzes through its 117 minute run time with little surprise and interest.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore, Woody Harrelson and Robert Redford do make events much more enjoyable than they ought to be, though. I liked their performances. Noteworthy, also, to see Oliver Platt and, minorly, Billy Bob Thornton.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty meh, but thanks to the main trio it's just narrowly a good watch."

As a young boy of 9 on my way to the cinema I wasn't at all prepared for the on-screen awesomeness I was about to witness, one of the defining movies of my childhood and of the modern age. With special effects that simply blew any and all previous dino movies out of the water, compelling story and the odd comic moment such as the Mr Arnolds arm it really did make that evening something I will remember forever. So successful it went on to spawn 3 sequels, the second was enjoyable, the third not so much. The newest Chris Pratt one, I'll leave that for you but its worth a watch, especially if you want to wash the taste of the 3rd one out of your mouth. It gave me nightmares for weeks, really really wonderful nightmares."

It very much has that vibe, and would have worked spectacularly to that end in a fun, meta, kind of way. But for better (_Maggie_) or worse (_Terminator 3_) Arnie just keeps on sluggin' and that's the world we live in.\r\n\r\nSo instead of that, I guess _Last Action Hero_ is really just a deconstruction of the over the top action movies the 80s and early 90s did with such aplomb. Is it a scathing criticism of them, or a love letter to them? I don't know, but _Last Action Hero_ works for me, and that's all I'm taking away from it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

That being the case, this first _Leprechaun_ movie is actually not very jokey (at least, not when you consider the fact that the villain of the piece is a three-foot-tall Irishman with a penchant for skipping, rhyming and polishing shoes). The effects are hit and miss, the acting is not very good, and a lot of the movie is shot too dark to make out properly, but _Leprechaun_ really is an okay horror movie. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

Pakula from John Grisham\u2019s novel, \"The Pelican Brief\u201d is a political drama/thriller about a law student (Julia Roberts) who researches the murders of two supreme court justices and shares her theory with her college professor (Sam Shepard) who, in turn, gives it to an FBI friend on a lark. The brief hits a nerve because people start dying one-by-one. Denzel Washington plays a DC reporter who teams-up with the student while Robert Culp appears as the president. \r\n\r\nWhile I prefer \u201cThe Firm\u201d (1993), which was also written by Grisham, this one is along the same lines, albeit with a totally different story (naturally). \u201cPelican\u201d has more action, but the plot/characters aren\u2019t quite as interesting IMHO. Still, if you liked one, you\u2019ll probably appreciate the other.    \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 21 minutes and was shot in New Orleans and Washington DC/Maryland. ADDITIONAL CAST: John Heard plays an FBI agent, Stanley Tucci a hitman and John Lithgow an editor.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

            "review": "What do you love about the law, Andrew?\r\n\r\nAndrew Beckett is a gay lawyer infected with AIDS, who in spite of being his law firm's rising star, is fired on a trumped up charge of negligence. Refusing to accept defeat, Andrew manages to enlist the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, whom it's hoped, can prove that the firm acted disgracefully out of fear of Andrew's illness. But can Joe throw off his own prejudice? Can Andrew keep it together as AIDS starts to take a hold? \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was the film to really bring the horrors of AIDS to the masses. Though certainly not the first film to deal with the subject, films such as \"An Early Frost (1985)\" and \"As Is (1986)\" had led the way, Philadelphia is certainly the most memorable of all the mainstream films dealing with the subject. \r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by, the film's standing has waned some what, gays have renounced the film as over sentimental gloop and various other cinema critics have accused the film of confusing its aims. The truth is that Philadelphia is only really guilty of playing it safe. Andrew Beckett is clearly wronged, and he's clearly a lovely and special man, supported by a complete and loyal loving family. It's the character set up that never really puts the film in any real danger of becoming edgy, even the strand dealing with homophobia is only briefly given credence. However, where the makers do achieve their aims, is with the emotional aspects, something that lifts Philadelphia to a far higher plain in the pantheon of emotional kickers. \r\n\r\nThe tone of the film is set courtesy of Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning \"Streets Of Philadelphia\", which acts as a sombre portent of things to come during the opening credit sequence. From here on in the story is content with gnawing away at our heart strings and breaking down prejudice barriers in the name of fair play and adult fallibility's. Part court room drama and part human tragedy, Philadelphia is never found wanting in the engrossing department, something that is in no small amount due to the work of a firing on all cylinders cast. \r\n\r\nTom Hanks is always pretty safe company to be in as a rule, but tackling the role of Andrew Beckett required much more than merely charm and a homely appeal. Hanks, winning his first Best Actor Oscar, steps up to the plate here and delivers one of the best performances of the 90s. As AIDS ravages his body and soul, Hanks as Andrew reaches deep down within and has the audience with him all the way through his ordeal. Alongside Hanks is Denzel Washington as Joe, who if anything has the more prickly role to contend with. It's probably not much of a surprise to most followers of his to say he's on his usual great form here, with a shift in his character's fortitude showcasing the best of the New Yorker's ability. Rounding out the cast, and with equally fine performances are Jason Robards, Joanne Woodward, Robert Ridgely, Mary Steenburgen and Antonio Banderas. Then as surely as Springsteen's opener had set the mood, Neil Young closes the film down with his own heart achingly brilliant \"Philadelphia\", playing alongside some video footage that finally seals the deal as to why Philadelphia as a movie exists. \r\n\r\nRevisits to the film show up its minor flaws, but as someone who remembers how he, and the other multi sexed audience reacted on leaving the cinema back in 1993, it's the kind of impact that to my mind can never be understated. 9/10"

            "review": "Jane Campion's third feature film, THE PIANO is a historical drama that tells of a Scottish woman, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter), who is married off to a colonist in New Zealand that she has never met. Ada is mute, a development that mysteriously came upon her in childhood, but she is a virtuoso pianist and her cherished instrument is one way she communicates her feelings to the world. As Ada and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) land on the shores of New Zealand's South Island sometime in the mid-19th century, her new husband Stewart (Sam Neill) ignores her sign-language entreaties to carry her piano inland along with their other belongings. Feeling no love for this man she has been forced to marry, Ada is drawn into sexual bargaining with another colonist, Baines (Harvey Keitel) who offers to get her the piano back if she does what he wants.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this film is an interesting study in sexual power and the tragedy of a woman's lot during this historical era. Neither Stewart or Baines are admirable men; Stewart is uncaring of Ada's true passion for the piano, but Baines exploits her distress and powerlessness to get what he wants and he doesn't respect consent. Unfortunately, as the film develops, Campion decides to ultimately turn this into a straight-up romance novel, where the heroine willingly gives in to the roguish bad-boy. I realize that Campion might go for the common desire of a woman to feel desired, but that shouldn't come at the expense of glorifying a creep as she does here.\r\n\r\nTo better serve as a foil for Baines, Stewart's squareness is played up, and the two characters are reduced to crude cutouts of a \"good guy\" and \"bad guy\". This extends to a critique of 19th-century colonialism and racism: naturally, as the man who audiences are supposed to feel is disgusting and unattractive, Stewart is keen on stealing land from the indigenous Maori people. Baines, on the other hand, as the cool heartthrob, hangs out with the Maori and respects their culture even to the point of learning their language and tattooing his face.\r\n\r\nWell, even if the actual plot is a ridiculous pulp fantasy, the production values are fine. New Zealand's wild shore and rainforests are memorably captured by cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh. The film has a distinctive blue cast that unites the thick cover of the forest and the depths of the sea. While some controversy remains about the depiction of the Maori people here, they are still given a great deal of screen time and the ability to speak their own language on film. The piano-heavy soundtrack by English composer Michael Nyman is deservedly celebrated: deliberately anachronistic, its saccharine, minimalist feel of the 20th century represents Ada's innermost thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere is good acting as well. Anna Paquin, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Flora, and one wouldn't expect such mature composure and convincing emotions from a child of this age. Holly Hunter has to convey everything through gestures and facial expressions and she does this marvelously. One of the delights of Campion's feature debut SWEETIE was Genevieve Lemon, and here in a supporting role she turns in here a mildly comedic performance that adds some levity to the severe sexual drama.\r\n\r\nSeeing it again some two decades after it came out, THE PIANO feels like a rather slighter film than I remembered it, and it is difficult to understand what drew critics to the time to rave about it. I would really only recommend this to people with a specific interest in New Zealand or Michael Nyman's soundtrack, but I don't see this as an all-time classic."

After Henry's arm is broken while trying to catch a baseball at school, the tendon in that arm heals too tightly, allowing Henry to throw pitches that are as fast as 103 mph. Henry is spotted at nearby Wrigley Field by Larry \"Fish\" Fisher, the general manager of the struggling Chicago Cubs, after Henry throws an opponent's home-run ball all the way from the outfield bleachers back to the catcher, and it seems that Henry may be the pitcher that team owner Bob Carson has been praying for.",

The fight choreography is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who has choreographed fighting in a number of great films, and later choreographed the fighting in The Matrix. His style is stamped all over the fights in the movie. As Kung Fu films go Iron Monkey has an  interesting story woven in among familiar tropes. You see plenty of thugs get their comeuppance and there are a few light comedy scenes as well. The story centres around the \"Iron Monkey\", a Robin Hood-like character who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, who has a Batman-like secret identity. It is much more than \"your kung-fu is no good, mine is better!\" and the main characters are genuinely likeable and well acted. I think the English voice actors do a pretty good job. The villains are cartoonish in their badness, and the heroes always win, which is typical of the genre. If you like the genre, this is definitely one worth watching. Because it has an interesting story, it's also fairly accessible to folks who are not big kung fu fans."

It\u2019s cute & comical and works up some quality suspense regarding the core question (Is she or isn\u2019t she?) and the writers came up with a worthwhile climax. Enough said.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, Oakland and Cloverdale, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

The gratuitous cleavage shots or the catchphrase?\r\n\r\nI did enjoy <em>'The Three Musketeers'</em> - but boy is there a load of cleavage shoved in your face. The famous Musketeer phrase is also said <b>a lot</b>.\r\n\r\nThis film is a little bit of a weird one, in terms of how I feel about it. It's clearly enjoyable but I wasn't sure if it deserves the step above rating that I've given, by the end I think it just about gets there. I like the plot, the locations and pacing, but it took a relative while for the cast to grow on me.\r\n\r\nChris O'Donnell (D'Artagnan) and Oliver Platt (Porthos) would be my standouts, I liked both of them pretty much from the beginning; it's my first time seeing O'Donnell, away from his <em>'Batman'</em> appearances, though have seen Platt a number of times.\r\n\r\nCharlie Sheen (Aramis) and Kiefer Sutherland (Athos) are the ones who don't work amazingly in my opinion. I don't love their acting styles here, while I didn't sense enough chemistry between the two - and Platt, for that matter.\r\n\r\nTim Curry, meanwhile, is always hit-and-miss to me - not helped by the fact that <em>'Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties'</em> is my biggest memory of him, I'm constantly hearing Prince XII whenever he talks - my apologies, Mr. Curry.\r\n\r\nLastly for the cast, it's also interesting (for me) seeing Paul McGann involved - I've very recently become aware of him through television's <em>'Luther'</em>. Funny ol' world.\r\n\r\nSorry for the few tangents there. My final thoughts on this film: It's entertaining. Worth a watch."

Add Val Kilmer, Sam Neill, and Bill Paxton into the mix and what you get doesn't exactly scream \"A list\" but what you do have is an ensemble cast that gels particularly well; this is one of those films that manages to be more than the sum of its parts. The bond of brotherhood and friendship between the Earps and Doc Holliday feels genuine and Kilmer clearly relishes the scene stealing part of sickly gentleman adrenaline junkie Holliday. Powers Booth and Michael Biehn also make charismatic villains, the scenes between Biehn and Kilmer being particularly sharp and the Peckinpah shoot outs extremely well staged. In fact the shoot out at the OK corral is one of the best versions yet filmed. It does occasionally slip into melodrama (Morgan's death being the prime example) and the climax is a little montage happy and feels a little rushed as a result, but it's a great slice of old school popular entertainment that's a lot more engaging than Kevin Costner's pompous yawn-fest released the same year."

            "review": "The King, Chiba, White Boy Day and Love\u2026Bloody Love.\r\n\r\nTrue Romance is directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Michael Rapaport, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jeffery L. Kimball. \r\n\r\nComic book store clerk Clarence Worley (Slater) falls in love with call girl Alabama Whitman (Arquette) when she turns up at the movie theatre as one of his birthday presents. Marriage is quick but as the whirlwind romance gathers apace, complications quickly follow in the form of psycho drug dealers and the mob! \r\n\r\nIt's still speculated on how True Romance would have panned out had Tarantino directed his own screenplay, but really in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. For True Romance is a wildly exciting fusion of lovers on the lam premise with violence a go go thrills. \r\n\r\nDirector Scott did a bang up job bringing Tarantino's screenplay to life, even making a couple of narrative changes that suits (QT agrees) the picture no end. People often get hung up on the fact that Scott had previously helmed Top Gun, Beverly hills Cop II and Days of Thunder, citing these as reasons that Scott was wrong for the material, yet the film he did immediately before True Romance was The Last Boy Scout, a thrilling and muscular actioner that pings with sharp savvy dialogue scripted by Shane Black. It was the perfect trial run for True Romance, and Scott proved to be a wise and cohesive choice for the material. He also expertly marshalled a large ensemble cast, garnering career high turns from Slater and Arquette in the process. \r\n\r\nAlmost everything clicks into place on True Romance, it never lacks for kinetic thrills or edge of the seat drama. In turn it likes to grab you around the throat with some wince inducing violence, cunningly drawing you in to root for a couple of lovers who will do anything for each other, while simultaneously causing carnage for all they come into contact with. There's odd ball characters galore (Oldman and Pitt excelling in this area), exquisite set-pieces and dialogue so sharp you could cut a steak with it. From conversations between Clarence and his imaginary Elvis (Kilmer) mentor, to iconography unbound with one of the 90s great sequences that sees Walken's mob boss verbally joust with Hopper as Clarence's stoic father, it's a film as rich in the art of vocal acting as it is in eye splintering gloss. All that and it's a clinically beautiful love story as well! \r\n\r\nA wet dream fantasy of QT for sure, and if you wanna be churlish? Then there should have been more room made for Sizemore and Penn's glorious coppers. Hell we could even complain about the editing being a touch too slam-bang at times\u2026But nah! Small complaints be damned, the meeting of Tarantino the writer and Scott the director delivers neo-noir goodies galore. In fact it's a film that just gets better with age. 9/10"

It stars Ed Harris, Madeleine Stowe, Benicio del Toro, Charles Dance and Patricia Healy. Music is by George Fenton and cinematography by Willy Kurant.\r\n\r\nTo be kind since China Moon is a very good film in its own right, that is for lovers of film noir and its off shoot neo-noir, it's a film where its only crime is not being as great as previous instalments of noirs classic era and neo. Story treads deliciously familiar ground, where Harris' intrepid cop falls deep for Stowe's sultry babe and before he can say \" I would do anything for you\", he's in it up to his neck.\r\n\r\nIn true noir fashion there's a twisty road to be navigated, nothing is as it at first seems, with hidden agendas, shifty shenanigans and emotional turmoil all playing a hand. The police procedural aspect intrigues greatly, with the devilish kicker of Harris investigating himself, while the intricacies of crime investigation - such as bullet science - is not given short shrift.\r\n\r\nAs a mood piece it scores high, the sweaty Florida settings ripe for Bailey (a cinematographer by trade) to mix a bit of poetic ambiance with misty shimmers, rainy bleakness and colour coded criminality that's not detrimental to true noir essence. Perfs are from the higher end of the scale, and the makers add enough original touches of their own so as to not let this become a pointless retread. \r\n\r\nClosing superbly with a double whammy finale, China Moon is one that film noir lovers should sample. 7/10"

I haven't even bothered seeing the original yet (the more highly-regarded work that surprisingly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Palance).\r\n\r\nI cared not a single whit about the plot--it was just fun watching the stars interact and riff off of each other. I did feel that the direction lagged in places, and perhaps a more objective editor could have sliced 10-15 minutes off and no one would have been the wiser. Not bad considering it was a sequel--it's worth a couple of watches, though I'm not surprised, and I'm a tad relieved, that no more of them were made."

Condensing Clancy's door stoppers is no easy task, but the makers here, headed by director Phillip Noyce, have manged to keep the pic brisk and intelligent for entertainment worth.\r\n\r\nPlot essentially boils down to America's war on drugs and the Colombian cartel at the helm of such operations. Naturally all is a bit suspect in the American corridors of power, leading to corruption and abuse of power that puts Jack Ryan firmly at the front to sift and destroy the bad eggs staining the American Star Spangled Banner.\r\n\r\nThis very much plays out for those who like a bit of politico subterfuge, whist being ok with long passages of like minded chatter is also a requisite. That we have a fine cast playing out the screenplay (Donald E. Stewart, Steven Zaillian and John Milius) is a big plus that gives credibility to the shifty machinations.\r\n\r\nThere's a nagging annoyance throughout that this still should be a better film, especially given the overstretched run time of 2 hours 20 minutes, and the computer sections are dubious and the finale is something of a damp squib. However, we are in the company of great pros, both in front of and behind the camera - and also on the page (Clancy's brain superlative). With that in mind it's reasons to seek this out and enjoy if this splinter of political thriller is your bag. 7/10"

            "review": "Over the years, I have really enjoyed Smith's comic book writing, but this is the only film so far I have seen him direct. My cinephilic friends tend to dismiss his recent works, but this was very enjoyable. I like the influence he has had on independent cinema. 1994 certainly proved to be an important year for it, with the smash successes that independent studios had with 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I hope he sticks to directing films that he himself writes. I have the feeling he wants to expand his horizons but isn't quite sure how to go about it without alienating his huge fanbase. I have great confidence in him, and feel that if he puts his heart into it, he can be a great filmmaker, instead of a good one. I think for him to do so, he could do himself a great service and read a few less comic books and watch a lot more movies, particularly by the Hollywood greats from the Golden Age, such as Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Raoul Walsh and John Ford. It would be quite exciting to see what he comes up with, once his creative juices are recharged."

            "review": "ust when you thought they'd never make a mystery thriller as deliriously bad as Midnight Lace, just when you imagined that the gold lame spirit of Douglas Sirk had departed forever, comes director Richard Rush's COLOR OF NIGHT to brighten up your dull evenings. Color of Night isn't just bad: it's bad with raisins in it.\r\n \r\n If you were one of the few who saw Color of Night in a theater, you probably remember the plot, but for those millions and millions who missed this gem, let's recap.\r\n \r\nBruce Willis stars as a psychologist. (Are you laughing too hard or can we go on now?) Willis is having a crisis of conscience/ confidence because one of his patients leaped out of a window after applying lots of lipstick. (We all know, don't we, that applying lots of lipstick is a sure sign of suicidal depression?) Anyway, Willis goes out to L.A. to visit fellow shrink Scott Bakula, who takes Willis to his group therapy session so that the fun can start in earnest. Remember \"The Bob Newhart Show\" from the '70's? His group therapy meetings weren't nearly as funny as these: we have a nympho, an obsessive-compulsive, a split personality, the Professor and Mary Ann -- well, you get the idea. Bakula gets killed in a scene that looks like Psycho directed by Mack Sennett. The sad part is that Bakula is the most talented and attractive member of the whole goddamn cast and 30 minutes into the picture he's been bumped off.\r\n\r\nWillis stays on in Bakula's grandiosely modern home (crammed with screamingly bad art) despite the fact that someone keeps stalking him and leaving snakes in the mailbox. (Are hotels in L.A. that expensive?) It's like the TV movie where that devil doll keeps chasing Karen Black around her apartment going, \"Yanni yanni yanni,\" and it never occurs to her to just leave.Instead of ruining the horribly implausible and helter-skelter plot for you, We'll just point out some of the more outrageous lapses of sanity: a) Willis's patient jumps out of a Manhattan office tower, causing pedestrians to scream and run, whereas real New Yorkers would have lifted her purse; b) Three days after famous psychologist Scott Bakula is killed in an exceedingly colorful way in his midtown office, his patients still don't know about it -- okay, we've already established that there are no reasonably priced hotels in L.A., but surely there must be at least one newspaper or TV station; c) The whole plot hook -- Willis goes color blind after seeing his patient's blood -- goes nowhere. Period. You keep thinking there has to be a reason for it or a plot twist that depends on it -- but nothing ever happens.\r\n\r\nThe film is a laugh riot and we don't want to give away all of the jokes. When we saw the film in the theater, the audience laughed all the way through the first sex scene, which took place underwater and was about as erotic as an Esther Williams movie. Oh, yes, we do get to see generous portions of Bruce Willis, though not as much as he'd have liked.\r\nThen there's the acting. Even the extras overact. Keep your eyes out for one unbilled woman playing a hooker in a police station. She only has one line, but she gives it such gusto that she will leave you stunned. Even formerly respected actors lose all sense of self-control; Lesley Ann Warren (decked out in a Shelley Long wig) twitches and twitters like a road company Billie Burke, and Ruben Blades does what appears to be a Jose Jimenez imitation. Willis actually seems like a model of intelligent understatement compared with the rest of the cast, but the truth is, he just wasn't acting at all.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Jane March. Ever so much of Jane March. Watching her try to match wits with Bruce Willis really makes you appreciate the bang-up job Cybill Shepherd was doing all those years. Jane spends half the movie dressed in disguise as a teenage boy. (How hard is she to spot? She's got teeth like Bucky Beaver! This gal could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence!) It all just gets sillier and sillier until the grand finale, which tried to come off as Hitchcockian but reminded us more of silent film legend Harold Lloyd. Judging by the guffaws from the audience, we weren't alone. So, watch Color of Night if you're feeling down in the mouth. Just don't try to eat popcorn during it -- unless you know the Heimlich maneuver."

That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord. \r\n\r\nThe Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skilful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills. \r\n\r\nAll told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10 "

Yet to think that they don't have fans from movie land would be wrong - case in point Death Wish 5: The Face of Death.\r\n\r\nOften considered to be the runt of the litter, it's actually better than what some would have you believe. OK! So the formula is the same as usual, Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey will have to take up his vigilante arms once again when someone close to him falls by the wayside. The law is still an ass and the bad guys can literally get away with murder, but they can't get away from crossing the path of Kersey.\r\n\r\nIt is what it is in that respect, another chance for Bronson to please fans of the series, to attack his role with machismo and a quip on the tongue. Where inventive deaths are conjured with a side order of vigilante relish. There's even strains of film noir in here, with a henchman as a transvestite and another with a dandruff problem that bothers him so. There's even a mannequin factory for added noirish flavours.\r\n\r\nThe production isn't exactly high end (tongue in cheek folks), and the usual suspension of disbelief is very much required, but for fans of Chuck and the series, then this delivers the goods. Bloodily so. 7/10"

This movie has pathos, sumptuous sets, costumes and screenplay, some utterly disturbing scenes and ideas, and culminates in classic tragedy."

I still have something to settle with you!\r\n\r\nGojira vs. Supesugojira (Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla) is directed by Kensh\u00f4 Yamashita and written by Kanji Kashiwa, \r\nHiroshi Kashiwabara and Shinichir\u00f4 Kobayashi. It stars \tMegumi Odaka, Jun Hashizume, Zenkichi Yoneyama and Akira Emoto. Music is by Takayuki Hattori and cinematography by Masahiro Kishimoto.\r\n\r\nGodzilla faces two new foes, Mogera - a UN built giant robotic machine, and Space Godzilla - a beast spawned from Godzilla's particles in space...\r\n\r\nOh how nutty it is, here we have part of what is known as the Heisei period of \"Zilla\" movies, and it's utterly bonkers. Is it meant to be a comedy, serious, thrown together quickly to make some money? Who knows? Who cares? Very divisive in Godzilla fan circles (totally understandable), pic throws a number of action series staples at the piece, slots in Godzilla's kid (a goofy looking Godzuki monstrosity), and pitches the moody big lizard against two foes that creates ultimate fire and destruction mayhem.\r\n\r\nGodzilla stomps the city of course, all while trying to keep out the telekinetic skills of the yummy Miki Saegusa (Odaka). There's some truly great matte shots in the mix, mad science, a nifty score that the likes of Williams and Barry wouldn't be ashamed of, and a traditional laser show of a finale smackdown. It's not great, in fact it's pretty dumb and maybe even lazy, but there is merit here for entertainment purpose. So strap yourself in, leave the brain at the door and enjoy the colourful carnage, it's trippy man! 6/10"

Unfortunately, it never takes off after the initial joke becomes tiresome; the characters are fat, that's basically it. It needed more meat on the bones (pardon the pun), too mediocre.\r\n\r\nStiller isn't great either, in a part which is basically a watered down version of the role he'd play nine years year, White Goodman, in <em>'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'</em> - he, surely, used this character, Tony, as inspiration for White? Elsewhere, you have two of the funnier kids from <em>'The Mighty Ducks'</em> series, as well as a few fairly known faces like Jeffrey Tambor (Maury) and Tim Blake Nelson (Roger).\r\n\r\nI get the intentions, but the heartfelt message that (I think) the film aims for doesn't really come out clearly. The ending feels like an unconnected add-on that was put in to add to the run time. In truth, it isn't anything terrible - I just wanted and expected more."

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn\u2019t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you\u2019re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I\u2019m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don\u2019t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven\u2019t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That\u2019s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can\u2019t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia\u2019s tears. Mufasa\u2019s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole \u201cremember who you are\u201d speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer\u2018s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It\u2019s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an \u201cokay\u201d scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a \u201cgood\u201d movie turn into a \u201cgreat\u201d one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn\u2019t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn\u2019t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It\u2019s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it\u2019s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba\u2019s roar \u2026 Damn it, I\u2019m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney\u2019s best. It\u2019s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone\u2019s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There\u2019s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they\u2019re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone\u2019s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, \u2026 Every single song is someone\u2019s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career\u2019s biggest role, Darth Vader isn\u2019t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character\u2019s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who\u2019s the \u201cbad guy\u201d, and that\u2019s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It\u2019s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba\u2019s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it\u2019s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can\u2019t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a masterpiece! It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an animated film. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was \u201cmade for kids\u201d. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it\u2019s undeniably one of Disney\u2019s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs \u2026 The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its \u201clive-action\u201d remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+"

Thankfully, things perk up in the second half when the forceful Jo (Winona Ryder) goes to New York City and develops a friendship with an amicable, but much older scholar (Gabriel Byrne). The ending is heartwarming.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting seeing all these actors when they were younger: Trini Alvarado as the oldest sister Meg, who\u2019s interested in a tutor that works next door (Eric Stoltz); Claire Danes as the sickly Beth; and Kirsten Dunst & Samantha Mathis as Amy, younger and older. Christian Bale plays the neighbor, Laurie, who becomes an honorary brother that loves the March family so much he desperately wants to be part of it. Meanwhile Susan Sarandon is on hand as the mother.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in British Columbia and Deerfield, Massachusetts. While the movie opened rather weakly at the box office during Christmas, 1994, it went on to become a surprise success.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. \r\n\r\nAfter Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. \r\n\r\nHarmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10"

Okay, Steven Seagal is not always a good thing but Michael Cane usually do not disappoint. I had seen it before but it was long time ago. Now I kind of wonder why on earth I did watch this movie again.\r\n\r\nThis is a typical example of the fact that an actor, even though he might have done a set of successful movies, should generally stay with what he does well and not be allowed to get into the directors chair. Especially not if he has some bullshit political agenda and plans to fill the movie with this.\r\n\r\nThere are some good moments in the movie where Steven Seagal is allowed to do what he does best which is fighting. Michael Cane is also good as always although his role is really so exaggerated that it borders on the ridiculous. His henchman is simply stupid. He is supposed to be an experienced tough guy and yet he panics at the first movement and shoots an Eskimo in front of the whole tribe. Yeah, right, very professional\u2026not! The team of mercenaries that they bring in is slightly better but even they are fairly amateurish with the possible exception of the team leader.\r\n\r\nThe pseudo-magic bla bla with the Eskimos in the middle of the movie could have worked in a different kind of movie but in this one it is just a boring filler.\r\n\r\nThe entire movie is basically done to promote Steven Seagal\u2019s political agenda protesting against big companies, the oil industry and his ideas about the future. I really do not like political propaganda in movies and this one is simply filled with tacky green left-wing nonsense. The propaganda speech at the end is so far off and ridiculously detached from reality that it is embarrassing. It is rumoured that this speech originally lasted 30 minutes but that Warner stepped in and cut it down (thank god).\r\n\r\nThe only reason this movie did not get an even lower rating by me is because Michael Cain is doing a good job of the lousy role that he has and that there are some decent fighting scenes."

            "review": "***The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\r\n\r\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.\r\n\r\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let \u2019em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God\u2019s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn\u2019t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\r\n\r\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Roger Avary.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A"

The gunman is Gus, a thief on the run from the police, who kidnaps the couple as an insurance policy, planning to use their home as a hideout. But their incessant bickering proves more than Gus bargained for, forcing him -- for the sake of his own sanity -- into the unenviable role of peacemaker. To make things even worse for Gus, he discovers that he has taken the couple hostage the night of their big Christmas party, and the guests are already on the way. Not wanting to leave Lloyd and Caroline unattended, Gus opts to attend the party, pretending to be the couple's marriage counselor. This naturally leads to a series of comic confusions, as the hostage crisis and marital tensions head towards their inevitable conclusion.",

The early moments are actually the best parts in my opinion, the rest of the 97 minutes are enjoyable enough though.\r\n\r\nAllen is easily the most standout part of the film, none of the other cast members really come close at all. Eric Lloyd does an alright job as Scott's son, Charlie. The festive music is pleasant, while the sets etc. look decent - the special effects aren't incredible, but are certainly serviceable.\r\n\r\nMany better Xmas productions out there, but there's enough here to feel entertained by."

It stars Alec Baldwin in the title role and support comes from John Lone, Penelope Ann Miller, Peter Boyle, Ian McKellen & Tim Curry. It's written by David Koepp who was a fan of the radio show that was re-run when he was a child. The plot basically sees Lamont Cranston (Baldwin) gain an alter ego (The Shadow) in mystical Tibet and with his new powers sets about fighting crime back in the states. All is going well until Shiwan Khan (Lone) shows up. He's the last descendant of Gengis Khan, and in keeping with that particular family tree, he's intent on global domination.\r\n\r\nThere's a lower tier of super hero movies that have either been poorly received in comparison to the big hitters like Bats, Supes and Spidey, or simply forgotten on account of how bad they are. The likes of \"Daredevil\", \"The Phantom\", maybe even \"Darkman\" and this here 94 piece, \"The Shadow\", are rarely mentioned by the super hero fan. Perhaps rightly it could be argued? But in spite of the tepid and unimaginative plot, \"The Shadow\" is an above average time filler that's at the least visually impressive. The 1930s Manhattan setting is excellently brought to life by the makers, and a pat on the back is due to them for not over doing the special effects. It looks and feels pulpy, and really there's nothing wrong with that at all. The cast in truth are just about OK, either under written or merely swamped by the production design, they turn up and play the movie as best they can.\r\n\r\nHardly ground shaking and not really pumping the blood as an action movie should. \"The Shadow\" does however have a dreamy quality that makes it worth a watch. Perhaps a sequel or a remake with a better story may just arrive one day? 6/10"

            "review": "_**Ambitious and High-Concept Sci-Fi (for Grown-Ups only)**_\r\n\r\nI can see WHY some don't like \"Generations\" (1994) or don't 'get' it: This seventh Star Trek film has some (false) plot holes and some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well (So what? Doesn't mystery intrinsically come with the territory of space adventure?); plus the story is a bit convoluted, particularly for those not familiar with Star Trek up to this point, both generations.\r\n\r\nRegardless, \"Generations\" is ambitious, high-concept sci-fi of the highest order; it leaves the viewer with many interesting questions to ponder long afterwards. Although the Nexus has been criticized as a mere gimmick to get Kirk and Picard together, I find the concept utterly fascinating: No matter how much we want it, an illusory paradise is just that, an illusion. As far as I'm concerned, the concept of the Nexus and its implementation into the storyline is nothing short of brilliant. Who created the Nexus? Why, who else but the Talosians, the 'antagonists' of Trek's very first episode, \"The Cage\"! Think about it.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there are multiple highlights (some SPOILERS follow): The usual Trek humor, Data's amusing experiences with the emotion chip, Malcolm McDowell's outstanding performance as the Soran, his believable obsession and justifications, B'Etor & Lursa and their \"wild bunch\" Klingons, the startling obliteration of them and their vessel, the thrilling crash-landing of the Enterprise-D, the meeting of Kirk and Picard in the Nexus, the final showdown with Soran and Kirk's death. Needless to say, \"Generations\" does far more than offer mere juvenile space battles.\r\n\r\nBIGGEST PLOT HOLE (OR MAYBE NOT): Picard's purpose in leaving the Nexus is to stop Soran from annihilating the Enerprise-D crew and the entire Veridian solar system, including the 230 million people that live on Veridian IV. Since Picard can leave the Nexus and \"go anywhere any time,\" as Guinan pointed out earlier, why go to Veridian III about A MINUTE before Soran launches his rocket? Why not go back to when Soran was a guest on the Enterprise-D and apprehend him then and there? Writer Ronald D. Moore defended Picard's decision on the grounds that he didn't want to risk the dangerous and unexpected consequences that can occur when tampering with the timeline; hence, his journey back in time from the Nexus is only a matter of a minute or so. It's a good explanation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of explanations, some have criticized the fact that Guinan is simultaneously present in the real world and in the Nexus. How could this be? It's simple: It is repeatedly established that the reality experienced in the Nexus is not real; one experiences what they desire in the Nexus, not what is necessarily real. For instance, Picard has no children in the real world, but because he DESIRED to have them he was able to experience them in the Nexus. Hence, the 'Guinan' portrayed in the Nexus may walk, talk and act precisely like Guinan, but she's not real. She's only there because Picard desires her to be there for the purpose of explaining the nature of the Nexus. That said, many of the people in the Nexus are real, like Picard and Kirk. \r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON THE NEXUS: Although the Nexus should simply be taken at face value as a strange space phenomenon (likely created by the Talosians), you can also regard it as an analogy. At first glance the viewer might get the impression that the Nexus is a type of heaven, but this can't be so since it is repeatedly emphasized in the film that the people and events experienced in the Nexus are NOT real (for the most part). 'Heaven,' a term theologians and ministers traditionally use to refer to the eternal abode of the redeemed (technically referred to as \"the new heavens and new earth\" in the bible, as shown in 2 Peter 3:13), is always depicted as real in the bible, not an illusory paradise. If the Nexus is not analogous of heaven, what could it be a type of? The Nexus corresponds to any addiction a person \"tastes\" and embraces to escape reality (e.g. pipe dreams, drugs, alcohol, computer games, TV, porn, fishing, shopping, golf, etc.). Some, like Soran, are unable to flee its clutches and waste their lives and talents OBSESSED by it. Others, like Picard and Kirk, are able to see the truth and escape; they therefore \"make a difference\" in real life.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This \"passing-of-the-torch\" installment requires an attention span and an appreciation for high-concept sci-fi; it will likely bore those for whom Star Trek only means neato spacecrafts and superficial space dogfights (don't get me wrong, they each have their place in Trek). \"Generations\" has the courage to make bold changes -- killing off an iconic character, and fairly prominent support characters as well, not to mention destroying the Enterprise-D. In short, \"Generations\" is science-fiction for grown-ups and youth with advanced cerebral development. All others should stick with juvenile space fantasy flicks (giggle).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A"

            "review": "Horrible watch, won't watch again, and don't let people watch this.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything past the premise of this movie is confusing and ridiculous, starting with the spelling, \"ThumbElina\"?  It should be \"ThumbAlina\", that's a nit pick, but it honestly made the movie harder to find.\r\n\r\nI love the premise of a tiny person \"birthed\" to a wanting mother, but after that, the problems set in.  Let's start with \"birthed\": she didn't magically appear out of the air, she wasn't born, she crawled out of a flower as a tiny adult, wearing a dress, and able to talk.  This is some fey granted wish nonsense if I ever saw one.\r\n\r\nI understand using the name Thumbelina to describe her size, as \"Fingerling\" would probably be inappropriate, but she is perilously tiny: able to be crushed without notice, any big animal (duck, goose, cow, horse) will eat her without noticing, she should have drowned in the first act, twice I think,  the wind alone would sweep her away, though she doesn't have to worry about falling to her death.  This girl is short to Tinkerbell, who is at least 6 inches, and Thumbelina is about 2 inches (and a half, maybe), so she's only coming up to Tink's booty.  The movie never clearly demonstrates this and morphs her body size anywhere up to a foot based on the needs of the scene.\r\n\r\nBugs that wear clothes, with human eyes and teeth don't bother me, I get that because they don't have faces that translate, but amphibians and birds with very human teeth and tongues (geese have their own teeth) is disturbing, and that swallow was downright horrifying.  It is a BIRD, the pinnacle of aerodynamic nature in, not only, boots, shirt, and a hat, but GLOVES, it may be the most distracting thing I've ever seen.  Even when you anthropomorphize a bird to use their wings as hands, gloves don't make any sense if they fly.  It was honestly worst than frog breasts, which I can't stand just as much, they just weren't as frequent.\r\n\r\nThen there are lots of (horny) bugs, but then there are bumble bees that act like dogs, but should be loyal to their queen, not a fairy.  We can blame fey magic, but since he has his own wings, he shouldn't RIDE it.\r\n\r\nNow, the actual story: it makes sense to split up the nature dynamics into \"nationalities\", and the world is crafted in some detail, but why did they chose these details.  We basically have a Spanish prince, a beetle pimp, a french...hobo(?) swallow, a mole that is a wealthy business man, and then the fairy kingdom which makes the most sense, other than they fail to have nature gradually deliver winter (why they're in charge, I don't know) and suddenly murder anyone who hasn't sheltered.\r\n\r\nThis movie has a problematic feminist story: she's born looking for companionship.  She gets desperate for anyone, then wants a prince, so she doesn't even necessarily want the only guy she's ever seen, until she knows he's the prince and he promises her all this stuff.  Then she's kidnapped, force on stage for entertainment (strips), led poorly by the hobo swallow, and pressured to marry the mole, but then marries the guy that sort of looks like her, and then he changes her to be just like him.\r\n\r\nJust watch \"Fern Gully\" or any of the Disney fairy stuff instead, please."

The government sets up a special police force (T.E.C.) to ensure the new technology isn't abused. Enter Max Walker, a Timecop who upon learning of a corrupt politician's plot to become president, sets about doing all he can to stop him.\r\n\r\nTimecop did exactly what I wanted it to do, namely give me Jean-Claude Van Damme administering brutal violence in a sci-fi haze. It's a nice central premise with it's time travel plot, the sound and effects are fine within the genre, and Ron Silver on villain duties does a nice take in sleazy, corrupt politician verve. It's all set up for explosions, kills and a chance for Van Damme to show off his excellent line in splits, kicks and body punching tricks. Some weak acting exists of course, and only a fool could not know how it's all going to turn out in the end. But really, in the context of the genres it belongs too, and the leading man's career overview, Timecop delivers all it promised to do in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'm off to see if I can change the past right now. 6.5/10"

I would never take it away from anyone, and there's absolutely stuff I like, but I can't really recommend it based on personal taste. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

The three astronauts and Mission Control must now focus on merely surviving and getting back alive, if possible. \r\n\r\nDirected by Ron Howard, \u201cApollo 13\u201d (1995) is a solid account of the real-life events and obviously influenced \u201cThe Martian\u201d twenty years later, which is even better, albeit not based on historical events. \r\n\r\nI suppose this zeroes-in on the weakness of this movie: If you\u2019re familiar with the account you know how the story ends, which diminishes suspense. Nevertheless, I found it interesting to observe the living conditions and challenges of real-life astronauts, as well as the resolve and ingenuity of the people at Mission Control to work with what\u2019s available and to figure out how to get the astronauts home.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes. CAST: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

Teaming up with a computer hacker, Stallone battles not only his pursuer but also an event from his past that troubles him so.\r\n\r\nWith Antonio Banderas and Julianne Moore in starry support, Richard Donner in the director's chair and the Wachowski brothers on writing duties, Assassins held the promise of a top line actioner. Sadly that promise is not met.\r\n\r\nThere's clear signs of the makers trying to make something more deep and cerebral, what ultimately transpires is a overly complicated - and way over long - picture. Punctured with great action scenes, none more so than an outrageous taxi ride that John Woo would be proud of, it's in the middle section where pic drags itself into needless slumber. By this mid-point, one has had enough of Banderas, who comes off more like a deranged excitable kid than someone to be feared. Donner really falters there, but conversely he gets an interestingly engaging tune out of Stallone. Moore is very good, and gets some good dialogue to spout, which is a rarity, though, since much of the chatter is mumbled or said in such agitated or broody manner that the sound mix strains for aural clarification.\r\n\r\nIt's not a stinker, and in its own way it's a diverting time waster, but too many holes and too many poor production desicions leave it knocking at the averageville door. 5/10"

Gone is the dark undertone from Tim Burton's visions, and the tight action sequences that marked Burton's debut out as a genuine genre piece of work, in their place comes sexy campery and ropey action set pieces. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake, Kilmer easily being the most boring actor to don the suit out of all of them, whilst O'Donnell simply can't act outside of Robin's cartoonery bravado. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party, it's a waste of the very talented Kidman's ability and a waste of the audience's time.\r\n\r\nIt's not all bad though, a comic book adaptation is only as good as its villains, and here we get a perfectly cast Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and a wildly over the top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey steals every scene he is in, it's almost too much, but as maniacal and exuberant as it is, it is the film's highlight and actually the film's saving grace (Tommy Lee Jones was reportedly unhappy from having his thunder stolen in the movie by Carrey). The script does work enough to make the story accessible to all ages, and there are enough crash bangs and wallops to entertain in that brain left at the door kind of way.\r\n\r\nThis was the biggest hit of 1995, so the paying public lapped it up and paved the way for another Schumacher film in the franchise, but with all that star power wasted, and nipples on the rubber suits, it's hard to see now why it was so popular back then. 5/10"

After watching the movie I really thought that Ethan & Julie must have dated 'cause their conversations were just flowing. Definitely a must see."

It consists of two people meeting, getting acquainted, discovering something profound and then forced to make decisions that\u2019ll determine the rest of their lives, as well as the consequences for those linked to them. \r\n\r\nSome questions addressed include: What if you\u2019re married and you meet someone you genuinely romantically love? What if you\u2019re single and you meet a married person you profoundly love? How far do you (or can you) wisely take the relationship? What about others who would be negatively affected by pursuing the relationship?\r\n\r\nThese are all honest questions that most people have to consider at one time or another in their lives. The movie\u2019s not corrupt for asking them or featuring a certain questionable act any more than the story of David & Bathsheba makes the Bible corrupt (or, arguably worse, the story of Judah & Tamar).\r\n\r\nOne character is too loose with morals, which he justifies by criticizing all the \u201cborders\u201d in life. But there are boundaries everywhere: National, state, county, city, school, government, business, social and\u2026 marital. The bottom line is: You\u2019re either married or you\u2019re not. If you\u2019re married that means you have a committed lifelong covenant with your spouse. That\u2019s what taking vows is all about. The movie tries to have its cake and eat it too by supporting such loyalty while flirting with the temptation to discard it in the name of true love. Regardless, the picture smacks of real life, real people, real (hard) decisions and is very well done, which is to be expected with Eastwood at the helm.    \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Winterset & Adel, Iowa.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

With \u201cCaspar\u201d there\u2019s Moriarty, but she plays the biyatch antagonist. There\u2019s also ricci, but she was only 14 during shooting, although she\u2019s effective in the role.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot at Universals City, California, with establishing shots of Rockport, Maine.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

I realize that in becoming great at anything in one's life,\r\nother things have to suffer, and with him it seems, at least to me,\r\nthat for everything he has undoubtedly accomplished in the filmic\r\nrealm, it's created a type of 'idiot savant' (it's simply an existing\r\nterm--I certainly don't mean it pejoratively)--that is, in social\r\nskills, at least pertaining to self-marketing, or getting across one's\r\npersona in the field, he is lacking--and it negatively impacts his\r\ncinema. And that's a dirty rotten shame, because this was a fine film.\r\n\r\nHe and his excellent approach to cinema remind me of the Heisenberg\r\nprinciple and make me: a) wish Lee could find more happiness in his\r\nlife, so that he can come across better, and thus have his personality\r\nnot negatively influence cinephiles like me; and b) wonder, like in 'A\r\nBeautiful Mind', if he was happier and more pleasant, if it would\r\nnegatively impact his filmmaking? Philosophical questions such as this tend to keep me up at night, unless I have some red wine, milk or chamomile tea to wear me out and soothe me.\r\n\r\n'Clockers' worked for me. Keitel was really on a roll when he worked in this, with 'Bad Lieutenant', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Smoke' all around this time. It was certainly a great vintage for him, and a fine time to sample his acting."

            "review": "A mutiny thriller that delivers the goods wholesale.\r\n\r\nRussian rebels have seized one of their government's nuclear missile bases and are threatening to attack the U.S.A. A patrolling US nuclear submarine is ordered to fire, but almost straight afterwards an incomplete counter order brings uncertainty. The submarine Captain and the Executive Officer come into conflict as to which order to follow, and thus the subs crew are torn as to which officer is right or wrong.\r\n\r\nDirected by Tony Scott, one could be forgiven for thinking that Crimson Tide would be an outlandish ball of explosions and slaughter, thankfully it isn't, as Scott gives us one of the best underwater thrillers going. Scintilating characters are cloaked in dynamic claustrophobia, and this coupled with the ever increasing unbearable tension, makes this a must see for fans of films that are scary because of what might happen, and not because of what many blockbuster film makers actually show you.\r\n\r\nThis is not a standard good vs evil plot piece, or even a good vs insane cretin film, this pitches old school stickler for the rules Captain Ramsey against the deep thinking common sense purveyor Lt Commander Ron Hunter. Ramsey believes that the completed order, which is basically to blast the Russians before they blast us type thing, should be followed, Hunter on the other hand feels that the second incomplete order must be clarified before any action is taken, because after all this could be nuclear war! The film then twists and turns as the sub is divided into two factions, mutiny is rife, but what will the outcome be? Can the radio be fixed to complete the order? Will it be too late? All these questions are tensely drawn out by Scott to get the maximum impact from what is an admittedly standard global crisis in waiting story.\r\n\r\nNo shortage of machismo here either, brutishly brilliant is how I find Gene Hackman in this, his Captain Ramsey is the quintessential leader of men. Then there is Denzel Washington as Ron Hunter, eloquently spoken and a voice of reason, his ruggedness coming to the fore as the submarine starts to implode. There are few better sights in 90s cinema than watching Hackman & Washington go at each other the way they do here, starting off as just a fractious relationship, it then explodes into a war of belief and wills. It's through these pair that the film's neutral stance shines bright, what would we do in similar circumstances? Who would we follow? Both men ethically right, yet both men accountable for probable disaster.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful picture, a lesson in tough tension building that is perfectly wrung out by a rousing Han Zimmer score, with the only weak point being a multi written script that tries to fuse pop culture references with technical lingo, something which doesn't quite sit right. However, even that can't hurt the excellently unfolding sequence of events that closes quite brilliantly with a written piece that all of us should take note of. 9/10"

She brings her A-game and definitely tries her best but this just isn't her thing, and Modine's clearly not blockbuster star material for action films. A few of Harlin's set-pieces worked particularly well, but he pandered too much for his wife. That can work if you're, say, the Rossellinis and you're filming a drama set in Italy, but it's not working here, though I'll adore Davis to my dying day. I will add that this is my 13 year-old son's favourite films. Very curious if they would have made sequels had it not bombed--the ending sure was open-ended enough to give off that impression.\r\n\r\nThis is one film that if you just sit back and enjoy the ride will offer you a guilty pleasure. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy popcorn films or have children. Not as enjoyable as the first two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' releases, but better than their subsequent sequels."

While she's not entirely convincing as a career-Marine, she's certainly more so than Demi Moore, who tried the stunt not long afterwards, and she's certainly believable as a caring teacher. An intriguing film for Simpson and Bruckheimer to be associated with, this was back in the day, after her career-defining 'Catwoman' role in 'Batman Returns' that she was still getting great starring roles (I greatly look forward to checking her out opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in 'The Age of Innocence'). My favourite work of hers will always be in 'Scarface', but this is right up there IMHO--some really fine acting by her. It's simply a shame only one note was asked of her--had it been a more multi-dimensional character (ie., love or family interests--I've read a possible romance scene with Andy Garcia was left on the cutting room floor so they could focus on her interaction with the students), it would have been even more inviting to watch."

            "review": "This is a terrific movie, with dramatic power and a balanced look at the issue of capital punishment. It is based on a true story written and lived by a nun, Sister Helen Prejean though, as usually happens, the story is modified to fit the needs of a dramatic movie. For example, the two inmates she provided spiritual advice to are merged into one for this film. As a side note, Sister Prejean has an uncredited appearance in a scene concerning a vigil.\r\n\r\nThe movie is gritty at times,but always watchable. Susan Surandon received an academy award for her performance.\r\n\r\nIn addition to it being a great movie, there are two soundtrack albums of note. The first is the soundtrack, featuring an array of songs by Springsteen, Johnny Cash and others. Also there is a movie score version, with music of a more atmospheric nature. I use it to read or write fiction to sometimes."

The follow up to their incendiary debut, Menace II Society, the Hughes brothers deliver another in your face picture that is quite frankly on a perpetual downer. This is no bad thing, though, as long as you are not looking to be cheered up.\r\n\r\nThat's Uncle Sam for you! Mean Green.\r\n\r\nThe pic very much harks back to the glory days of film noir in the 40s and 50s, where some talented film makers began to tell stories of returning war veterans finding what they left behind is now alien to them - with some characters, as is the case here - deeply scarred by their experiences. Add in some gangster elements and the coup de gr\u00e2ce that is the scintillating heist, and clearly the brothers have seen many an old classic film. That the narrative is tried and tested stops the piece hitting greater heights, this in spite of some super acting (especially Tate and the always value for money Keith David) and the hard hitting violence that pierces the senses. Predictable yet potent, and certainly memorable, it's well worth a look for the tough of mind and the classic era film of heart. 7/10"

It stars Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, Don Cheadle and Maury Chaykin. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.\r\n\r\nCarl Franklin had already laid down a considerable neo-noir marker with his searing 1992 thriller One False Move, here he goes more traditional but garners equally impressive results. Plot has Washington as a WW2 veteran who has lost his job and desperately needs money to keep hold of his pride and joy - his house. Taking on a job offered by shifty DeWitt Albright (Sizemore), to find a missing woman, Rawlings quickly finds himself in up to his neck in murder and deception, he must turn ace detective to save his skin.\r\n\r\nSet in late 1940s Los Angeles, what instantly stands out is the period detail. The clothes, the cars and the establishments frequented by Easy and company. With voice over narration also provided by Washington, in dry and sardonic tones, it's every inch a loving ode to the film noir movies released at the time the pic is set. There's plenty of neon signs about the place, some bad ass cops, good sex, brandy and sharp suits, smoking and coolness and of course a psychopath in the classic mould (Cheadle excellent).\r\n\r\nBut of course noir dressage is only that if you haven't got a good pot boiling plot, thankfully this has one. The story takes unexpected turns, always remaining interesting, the distinctive characterisations breathing heavy, managing to off set the run of the mill stereotypes in the supporting ranks. It can be argued that Beals as the titular femme fatale of the title is under written, but the character comes with an air of mystery that serves Franklin's atmosphere very well. Tech credits are high, something of a given with Bernstein and Fujimoto on the list, while Washington turns in another classy show of subtlety and believability.\r\n\r\nLovers of film noir should get much rewards from Devil in a Blue Dress. 7.5/10"

It's an interesting idea acted well by very good actors (a lot of people dismiss Marlon Brando's work here, but I don't think it's that bad, honestly). If anything, the problem here is the movie doesn't know where to go after it's decent start."

Based on the novel of the same name by Paula Gosling, the story had previously been filmed as Cobra (1986) starring Sylvester Stallone. For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek. As far as her bad acting goes, Cindy Crawford said it best, taking the high road with \"Oh well, at least I tried.\" Indeed, she deserves an \"A\" for effort."

            "review": "***\"You have to not care whether you live or die\"***  \r\n\r\nThere were three medieval/British Isle films released in 1995 -- \"Braveheart,\" \"Rob Roy\" and \"First Knight.\" Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\" is certainly the most epic of the three at three hours, but I found it overrated; which isn't to say I don't like it, I just don't feel that it's as great as the hype would suggest (only about half of it is worthwhile). I liked \"Rob Roy\" better than \"Braveheart;\" it's very adult-oriented, violent, gritty and grim, however.\r\n\r\n\"First Knight\" is a believable take on the King Arthur/Camelot legend starring Sean Connery as Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere. They get tangled up in a bit of a love triangle. Ben Cross plays the villain, ex-knight Malagant. \r\n\r\nBeing a relatively realistic portrayal of the folkloric story, the tone is similar to \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u201d (1991), but without the witch and the campy Alan Rickman. So don\u2019t expect any of that silly magical jive with Merlin, Excalibur, etc. This might explain why so many pan the film, but I don't get their beef. Aren't there enough cinematic depictions of the Camelot tale with supernatural elements for them to enjoy, like 1981\u2019s \"Excalibur\"? I'll put it this way, \"First Knight\" is to the Arthur/Lancelot legend what the film \"Troy\" (2004) is to the Helen of Troy chronicle, although \u201cFirst Knight\u201d is less gritty.\r\n\r\nThe film caught my fascination right away with the character of Lancelot. He is portrayed as an expert swordsman, drifter, loner and all-around lost soul. The beginning reveals something integral to understanding his character: Lancelot takes on an intimidating dude in a swordfight contest at a village he\u2019s traveling through. After Lancelot prevails, the big guy asks him for advice on how to be as skilled a swordsman. Lancelot tells him that he needs a couple of obvious sword-fighting skills, to which the man confidently replies, \"I can do that.\" Then Lancelot tells him the last quality he needs: \"And you have to not care whether you live or die.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a powerful scene; Gere plays the character very convincingly (in fact, if you hate Gere, this film might give you a new-found respect for him). This character-defining episode reveals HOW Lancelot is the only one able to prevail against an incredible and decidedly deadly weapons gauntlet later in the story, which is a highlight.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the film is just a solid medieval/British Isle adventure with a noble folkloric tone, requisite forest scenes and all. What I mean by \u201cfolkloric\u201d can be seen in Lancelot\u2019s heroic rescue of Guinevere in Malagant's cave fortress, which is pretty implausible. But these are larger-than-life figures, right?\r\n\r\n\"First Knight\" more than satisfied my hunger for a medieval/British isles flick and surprised me with the intriguing character of the suicidally-brave Lancelot. If one doesn't have hang-ups regarding the absence of Merlin, Excalibur and the magical baggage that goes with 'em, this is an entertaining and classy heroic film.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, the movie features a fascinating allegorical subtext: King Arthur is God, Camelot is Heaven, Malagant is the fallen Lucifer, his dark, cavernous \u2018castle\u2019 is the Underworld, Guinevere represents humanity caught in the epic fight between good (Arthur) and evil (Malagant), and Lancelot represents worldly temptation.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Wales & England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

At the same time horrifying new organisms are discovered in Japan. These crustacean like beings are seemingly born of the Oxygen Destroyer, which was the weapon that killed the original Godzilla. From such things the mighty Destoroyah is born - the toughest enemy Godzilla has ever faced...\r\n\r\nIt's not only the last of the \"Heisei\" era of Godzilla, it's also one of the best in the whole franchise. It was meant to be the swansong for the big atomic lizard, which would have been fitting as it happens, but when Centropolis took up the rights and produced the must chastised 1998 blockbusting Matthew Broderick pic, things changed...\r\n\r\nG-Force is on the case here trying to find out what the hell is going on (armed with the new awesome Super-X III), which brings in the human facor coupled with some wonderful sci-fi babble. Godzuki is in here, but he's not the cute goggle eyed cuddly thing we have seen before, he looks like the big parent only in smaller form - and here having junior in the piece works.\r\n\r\nThe effects work isn't the best of the series, and some of Destoroyah's abilities are strangely not explained - which is annoying. Fans of all things \"Zilla\" will rejoice at the nods and homages to the past \"Zilla\" entries, which is credit to Toho Studio for showing respect to their baby (and the fans). \r\n\r\nThe great Akira Ifukube came out of retirement to musically score this one, and he doesn't disappoint, blending the traditional Tokyo stomp thunders with emotional swirls. Ah yes, emotion, this be the one that has it in utter abundance. There is wonderful colour, carnage, laser shows and beast smack downs, but ultimately the emotional heart of the pic is what rises it up towards the top end of the Godzilla franchise. 8/10"

            "review": "Matthieu Kassowitz's <i>La Haine</i> (Hate) is a portrait of youth disenfranchisement and the ensuing rage set in the public housing projects outside Paris. Before this film was released, many foreign viewers knew only the well-dressed, white, reserved and educated France depicted in e.g. films of the 1960s New Wave. Even many French people were unaware of the darker undercurrents of their own society, as no film had dared to handle this subject matter before. <i>La Haine</i> was a bombshell. While shot in 1995, it remains entirely topical today, as riots have continued to make the news in recent years.\r\n\r\n<i>La Haine</i> follows one day in the lives of three young men of different ethnic backgrounds all born and raised in one particular housing project: the aggressive Jew Vinz (Vincent Cassell), the insecure, clownish Arab Sa\u00efd (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui) and the more level-headed, pensive sub-Saharan African Hubert (Hubert Kound\u00e9). The film opens on a spring morning, in the aftermath of a riot which has rocked these youths' housing project. Some cars and buildings are destroyed, and the news reports that a police officer has lost his gun in the chaos of the night before. During the 24-hour period before the film's shocking ending, this trio tours the bittersweet environment of their housing project (violence and poverty on one hand, loving families on the other) and, in an effort to pick up money owed to them, they navigate the alien environment (rich, educated, white) of downtown Paris.\r\n\r\nThis is not only a revelatory film in showing viewers a side of France they had never seen before, but it is also extremely entertaining. The performances by these relatively unexperienced actors are totally convincing, Vincent Cassell in particular. Kassowitz shuns his country's own film tradition and instead sculpts the action under inspiration from the USA. However, the \"urban\", \"hip-hop\" aesthetic he employs does not lower the film to the more vacuous Hollywood productions but instead is at the level of Spike Lee and Scorsese. The director's decision to print the film in black and white has imbued it with a gravitas that makes it timeless. That said, in spite of the fine acting and ethnographic detail, the plot itself is rather mundane, which holds me back from giving this too high a rating."

            "review": "You don't live with me, you live among the remains of dead people.\r\n\r\nHeat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.\r\n\r\nBig time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.\r\n\r\nIn the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack.\r\n\r\nRarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law.\r\n\r\nFor Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nThere is enough in Heat to fill out a dozen other cops and robbers films, fans of neo-noir and crime films in general are spoilt supreme here. It's not rocket science really, put a group of great actors together, give them an intelligent script to work from and let them be guided by a director who will not sit still, and you get a great film. Heat, the ultimate predator and prey movie, where from beginning to end it refuses to be lazy or cop out, and energy and thought seeps from every frame. 10/10"

Unfortunately, when it comes to the film industry, the plot-link is kind of the most important one, so I can't really call Judge Dredd a success. And although the general premise is strong, this is not to the credit of the movie, seeing as it sources its material from the comic books of the same name, and 2000 AD.\r\n\r\nSylvester Stallone (the titular Dredd) and Rob Schneider (his offsider) are perhaps poor casting options. But they aren't so terrible as to make Judge Dredd unwatchable, especially seeing as there are a quite a few good choices to balance this out.\r\n\r\nDespite being made in '95, it shares that intrinsically 1980's vision of a dystopian future, where all the buildings are black, all the signs are neon, and all the residents are androgynous punks and goths. Which to be honest I'm a huge sucker for, so this earns Judge Dredd some points (though again, not for originality).\r\n\r\nIt's perhaps not the sort of description you'd expect of a violence-heavy, guilty-pleasure dodgy sci-fi, but Judge Dredd is just so cute! The ABC Warrior I have a particular soft spot for, but even overall, the piece is enjoyable to not take seriously (though taking it seriously is probably impossible).\r\n\r\nYes it's true that Judge Dredd is enjoyable in a laughing at it kind of way rather than a laughing with it one, but that's still enjoyable in my books.\r\n\r\n51%\r\n\r\n -Gimly"

The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed.\r\n\r\nSimple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects -said the critics - Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005), an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on the effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?\r\n\r\nYes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing either. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs, they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10"

            "review": "Mortal Kombat was one of the most popular, and controversial video games of the 90s, so naturally, in 1995, New Line Cinema released a live- action film adaptation. When the film was being advertised, several people were either excited for it, or skeptical due to Street Fighter being a total stinker, and since the film was rated PG-13, which meant the violence and gore from the game had to be toned down to appeal to the then-young MK fan base. Thankfully, all expectations were surpassed as Mortal Kombat actually turned out to be, believe it or not, a good video game movie. Upon its release, the film was, surprisingly, a box- office success, making it the first video game adaptation to be successful both financially, and with fans, despite mixed reviews from critics (although Gene Siskel gave the movie a thumbs up). To this day, it is considered one of the better game to film translations. Now, it's time to find out why that is the case.\r\n\r\nThe film succeeds by sticking to the plot of the first game while incorporating elements from Mortal Kombat II. The plot itself is very similar to Enter the Dragon (which I consider to be the greatest Martial Arts film ever made), but with a supernatural twist to it, which is rather refreshing, and helps it stand on its own. Unlike Street Fighter where the focus was on Guile instead of Ryu and Ken (the original protagonists of that franchise), this movie centers mostly around the Mortal Kombat game's original protagonist; Liu Kang.\r\n\r\nAll of the characters from the first Mortal Kombat game (as well as a few from MKII) are present in the film, and are given appropriate development, and screen time. The casting is also spot-on. This is one of the few adaptations of a video game, comic book, and cartoon show (at least one of the few I could think of) where all of the actors are cast perfectly. Christopher Lambert, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are especially great as Rayden and Shang Tsung (respectively), they deliver the right amount of charisma without chewing the scenery. Linden Ashby also plays a great Johnny Cage since he brings the character's cocky personality to life, and delivers some of the best humor in this movie. But my favorite casting choice in the film has to be Robin Shou as Liu Kang. Not only is Liu my favorite character in the games, but Shou looks very much like the character, and makes you feel for him by showing his impulsiveness, and guilt over the death of his brother. It's a shame he didn't receive more starring vehicles after this movie, because I feel he is a capable actor, and Martial Artist. He definitely has more of a personality than Steven Seagal.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie is rated PG-13, and doesn't contain the large amounts of gore from the game, it does make up for this area with the large amounts of Martial Arts action. The fight scenes are very well done, and often emulate more of the Hong Kong style of fight choreography, which was a refreshing change from most American action films prior to this. They also incorporate several of the special moves from the game, such as Liu Kang's bicycle kick, Scorpion's spear that comes out of his hand, etc., and they manage to make them look believable, and not embarrassing, unlike Street Fighter.\r\n\r\nThe person who directed this movie is Paul W.S. Anderson, and if that name sounds familiar, that's because this is the same man who would later go on to butcher Alien vs. Predator, and the Resident Evil movies. Despite his more recent efforts, he does a solid job directing this film. One of the strong points of his direction (aside from how well he filmed the fight scenes) is how he handled the movie on a technical, and design level. The cinematography, set designs, and lighting are stylish, and keep in touch with the game's dark, and mystical atmosphere. The special FX in the movie are also pretty cool, granted, they aren't exactly Terminator 2, or Jurassic Park, but they work fine for a film released in 1995. Though not everything is CGI, the character of Goro is a puppet, which still looks good to this day, and were created by special FX masters Alec Gillis, and Tom Woodruff, Jr.\r\n\r\nOverall, Mortal Kombat is still a fun film to watch. It made up greatly for Street Fighter, and in my opinion, it still is one of the best video game movies (right up there with Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist). It may not be Oscar winning material, but it is one of my personal favorite movies, and as a huge fighting game fan, I couldn't be any more proud of it."

Glenne Headly plays his wife, Jay Thomas the coach, Olympia Dukakis the principal and William H. Macy the irritating vice principal.     \r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus\" (1995) is a good school-oriented drama that\u2019s episodic in nature since it spans 30 years. The first 40 minutes were decent, but I was wondering if the film would be able to absorb me into its story, especially considering its considerable length. It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).  \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s kind of a meshing of \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d (1989) crossed with \u201cForrest Gump\u201d (1994), although not great like either of those flicks. But it\u2019s a solid drama. A 19 year-old Alicia Witt is on hand as one of the students in the first act.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes and was shot in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Marylhurst.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

The entire movie is based off a fear mongering joke/concept that our lives are controlled by computers, which in 1995 wasn't really the case, but in 2020 is much more true in the way that the movie wants to say.\r\n\r\nWhat actually makes the movie is that the movie isn't centered on manipulating the information, but uses it as adversity that the protagonist can overcome.\r\n\r\nEssentially this comes down to a \"average person\" in a \"spy movie\" trope.  I think puzzle fans will like this one as it is a lot of \"If X and Y, then what do you do?\".  And we know Sandra Bullock doesn't shy away from a little action."

            "review": "Erotic thriller dulls the senses...\r\n\r\nBrian De Palma has often come in for some flak over the years, his penchant for sticking tight to Alfred Hitchcock thriller formula has been the source of much consternation in certain quarters. Yet when you view something like Peter Hall's Never Talk to Strangers it rams home just how welcome it is to have Hitch like thrillers at least done well!\r\n\r\nRebecca De Mornay is a troubled shrink who whilst dealing with the mind games of a serial killing loony (Harry Dean Stanton), meets sexually charged Latino guy (Antonio Banderas) and indulges in passions unbound. Then she starts to get very unwelcome presents in the post...\r\n\r\nThe erotic thriller has been well trodden, and will continue to be so for sure, so it feels a little churlish to decry Hall's movie for coming off as a weak willed imitator of previous purveyors of the sub-genre, but this blend of Silence of the Lambs meets Sea of Love - cum - Dressed to Kill - cum Fatal Attraction etc etc just comes across as a cheat. And that's because it is!\r\n\r\nThe makers know this and try to hide their ridiculous folly behind eroticism as the two lovely looking headlining stars get sweaty and wet, indulging in sexual play that's as powerful as the surroundings (Banderas lives in a loft apartment resplendent with metal cage and wrought iron doors). But, or should that be butt? The mystery element is weak, the suspense equally so, while the back story of De Mornay's father (a key character) is hopelessly under developed.\r\n\r\nThen there is H.D. Stanton, stealing every scene is he is in, quid pro quo indeed, yet he's hardly in the film, which ultimately proves to be a tragedy as the plot hurtles towards its implausible and risible revelations. Red herrings come and go as quickly as Becca and Tony's underwear (the continuity editor should have been sacked along with the writers because of one scene BTW), and even though Pino Donaggio scores the music with customary swirling qualities, this just comes off as a piggyback tactic...\r\n\r\nThis is a poor thriller in spite of two very committed and visually attractive perfs from the leads - and of course Stanton's knowingly sleazy turn. Seek this out only if you think Body of Evidence is in the upper echelons of erotic thrillers. 5/10"

While Dustin Hoffman seeks to find an antidote, the two generals in charge of the quarantine (Morgan Freeman & Donald Sutherland) strangely decide to annihilate the town. Can Hoffman find a cure in time? And, even if he does, can he stop the firebombing?\r\n\r\nWolfgang Petersen's \"Outbreak\" (1995) is an outstanding drama/thriller, which I suppose you could designate as a disaster flick. Although viruses are so small they're invisible, they have the potential to be the biggest monsters of all. Certain deadly viruses, if let loose, can wipe out an entire town in a couple days. This is the scenario in \"Outbreak.\" It COULD happen and is therefore realistic, which naturally makes the story more horrifying than most horror flicks or monster movies.\r\n\r\nBut \"Outbreak\" is more than just a scary what-if story, the second half involves a military cover-up and is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, all the way to the final minutes. It's like an avalanche that slowly builds momentum.\r\n\r\nCuba Gooding Jr. is also on hand in a significant role as Hoffman's partner in the race-against-time. And, for those who care, there's a romantic subplot about Hoffman\u2019s character and his ex-wife, played by Rene Russo. Will they get back together?\r\n\r\nThe locations are magnificent, filmed in the coastal towns Eureka, Arcata and Ferndale, California, all in the extreme Northern part of the state, just south of the Redwoods and West of Bigfoot territory (i.e. Willow Creek). The African sequences were shot in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This is top-of-the-line cinema \u2014 equal parts scary, dramatic and suspenseful.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

The premise raises noteworthy thoughts regarding British colonisation. It isn't perfect and isn't in-depth by any means, but I like what the film takes on.\r\n\r\nIrene Bedard does well in the lead role, while the seemingly ever topical Mel Gibson supports ably. It's also interesting to hear a young Christian Bale involved as Thomas. Billy Connolly appears too, though only minorly.\r\n\r\nThe animation and music are the key parts to this. The songs aren't massively memorable but are catchy, the score is solid throughout but really comes up big at the end. Most of the humour, mainly with the animals, is fun too.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a production worth watching."

But tackling both these challenges is nothing to the one which director Sam Raimi asks of the audience in his stab at the genre. \r\n\r\nA female gunslinger is here played by a Hollywood beauty, Sharon Stone, but she isn't right for the lead role. She obviously looks gorgeous and she broods and pouts better than most of her modern day peers, but she lacks a menacing streak, a bit of believable nastiness that just might have lifted the film to better heights. We understand and expect the vulnerability she shows, but to succeed here in the testosterone fuelled town of Redemption, she's going to have to convince as a tough gal. And Stone just isn't up to the task.\r\n\r\nThe film does have good points to enjoy though, very much so. The story, although gimmicky, works well as an entertaining popcorn munching tale, while the cast list reads like a whose who of solid and quality thespers,  (Gene Hackman wandering in from Unforgiven to play Little Bill's ghost, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DeCaprio, Keith David, Pat Hingle & Lance Henriksen). Also into the plus column is the always impressive cinematography from Dante Spinotti, and there is no denying Sam Raimi's keen eye for detail, with his zooming shots a real treat during the shoot out sequences - his Spaghetti Western leanings further enhanced by Alan Silvestri's pasta influenced score.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this bravado attempt, and acknowledging that the makers have tried something different, The Quick & The Dead isn't quite quick enough on the draw to outlive the leading lady misstep. 6/10"

            "review": "Do not think that all sins go unpunished in this life, Montrose. \r\n\r\nRob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub.\r\n\r\nNeeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows \u00a31,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born.\r\n\r\nBeautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different and more reflective type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department as well. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats - even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish...\r\n\r\nCast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for being dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, and thus Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. However, it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new there? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. Yet they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10"

It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.\r\n\r\nHaving been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\r\n\r\n\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"\r\n\r\nSeven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\r\n\r\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10"

The \"anti-Jaws\" approach of showing the monster off is really cool as the premise is largely how detailed and dangerous the xenos is, but the approach removes a lot of the suspense in the hunting and subterfuge, almost humanizing her as \"hunted by the evil government entity\".\r\n\r\nWhile it would be a much different, and arguably better, movie to do something more like \"The Thing\", that she only has one human mask sorts of outs her, making it more like a spy movie, and I think they did really well with that in mind.\r\n\r\nIt just lacks the level of nuance and hidden information that spy and thriller movies tend to have.\r\n\r\nIt's much closer to \"Aliens\" than \"Alien\"."

            "review": "You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen.\r\n\r\nWaterworld is directed by Kevin Reynolds and jointly written by David Twohy, Peter Rader and Joss Whedon. It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dean Semler.\r\n\r\nIt's the future and the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth is practically covered by the sea. As civilisation is forced to live on the water, their only hope is to one day find the fabled place known as Dryland. A Mariner drifter may hold the key to Dryland's whereabouts...\r\n\r\nIt was by definition a troubled shoot, with sackings, difference of opinions, cost overruns, production set backs (hurricane destroying a hugely expensive set) and bad word of mouth generated by a film press intent on giving Kevin Costner a good kicking. Facts are, now that all the water has evaporated over the years, Waterworld is neither the flop or the bad film that many believed it to be. Should it be a better movie considering the gargantuan amounts of cash spent on it? Absolutely, without question! But Waterworld turned a decent profit in spite of its problems and mixed reviews, and now it firmly has a fan base willing to love it for the great sci-fi escapism that it is. Now readily available in 3 cuts (Theatrical, TV Edit and Ulysses), you can sample each to find the pros and cons of home format film tampering.\r\n\r\nEven in its theatrical form the film is still a rollicking water based adventure, full of spectacular stunts (oh my those jet-skis rock), amazing sets (whoosh, the sci-fi grandeur of the floating atoll) and blood pumping scenes (the eerie journey and subsequent revelation of a city under water). Sure it's far from flawless as the pace is uneven at times and as plot narratives go it's pretty thin, but Reynolds and Costner have crafted an impressive world submerged by water. The cast, too, are delivering knowing performances. Costner's Mariner is indeed one note, unsympathetic and moody, this guy is a loner and a mutation after all, his sombre persona neatly playing against Hopper's cartoonish, satirical and maniacal villain. Tripplehorn (a porn star name if ever there was one!) beautifully shines in a film populated predominantly by males (there's another flaw for you), Michael Jeter scores favourably as a highly strung elder, while young Majorino is suitably winsome, neatly playing it as a device to mellow the Mariner's cold fishy heart. Take that and fill it out with the detail of the definitive cut (Ulysses) which showcases Reynolds' vision and it's fan nirvana all round.\r\n\r\nIf it was meant to be a serious picture in the first place, a sermon on topical destroying of the Earth, then it fails a touch because the characterisations are bound by clich\u00e9 manacles. Yet collectively the inhabitants of this Waterworld share a common goal of survival, played out to the backdrop of Reynolds' excellent futuristic setting. When thrust together to make a good versus evil action movie, the characterisations work handsomely within that framework. That is ultimately the best way to enjoy Waterworld, let it wash over you (hrr hrr hrr) in a wave (hrr, OK I'll stop now) of water based action and heroics. It's a world where soil is currency and smoking is a marker for being a bad guy. From the opening shot of the Universal World logo becoming submerged in water, to the bittersweet finale, yes! Waterworld is indeed escapism in its purest cinematic form and becomes a high definition must in the process. 8/10"

Sure there are movies about comas, amnesia, lying, but they don't do it in the same way, and I honestly believe it's because this movie did it so well that no one wants to risk copying it and do worse.\r\n\r\nThis is also a great example of good situational comedy without bleeding over into abuse humor: at no point is she \"suffering\", she's not attacked, or wronged, but she's in a difficult situation that doesn't lend towards pleasantness in a ridiculous fashion, mostly because the family is insane, in the best of ways.\r\n\r\nEvery single actor in this really brings it too.  There are plenty of notable names, but as much as Sandra Bullock elevates the quiet, reserved character of Lucy, there are so many other good actors and characters throughout the movie, it feels extremely balanced, despite all the different story angles happening.\r\n\r\nThe other thing happening is that this is sort of a reverse mystery.  Instead of information that other characters know being hidden from the audience to be revealed later, the audience is almost the only one to know the truth until aspects are slowly revealed to the rest of the cast.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't see this yet, put it on your list, I promise it still holds up: even if there are no smart phones yet, you'll barely notice."

Sure it's a little X-Files-y, and a lot of the twists are either glaringly obvious or make zero sense, but by and large it's pretty original. The climate-change message does beat you over the head a little, but only gently, which I can handle. Obviously it didn't take anyway, considering we're here twenty years later and the problem's only gotten worse.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

Your God scares me.\r\n\r\nStarring Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans, the former a criminal, the latter a cop, plot sees the mismatched pair thrust together to bring down a criminal kingpin (James Caan). So it's all set up nicely for a high energy action comedy from the realm of buddy buddy bonanza. Sadly it has energy to burn but the execution of the comedy is weak to the point the makers have to resort to the base level of comedy writing to try and get laughs. \r\n\r\nThe odd line raises a chuckle, but quite often this is followed by a period of inanity, which in turn is followed by a ballsy action sequence (the makers very aware they quickly need to keep the demographic genre fans back on the clock). All this while a budding bromance - that's coupled with some lame homophobic undertones (a revolver up the butt gag? Seriously?) - threatens to turn it into the Brokeback Mountain of the buddy buddy action genre of film. Hell! the screenplay even has the whiff of misogyny about it. \r\n\r\nThe stars are badly served by poor writing and direction, but they themselves are guilty of offering up a chemistry free movie that dulls the senses during all the interim talking sequences. It's hard to believe this is the same pair of actors who have The Wedding Singer and The Last Boy Scout on their respective curricula vitae. This is a waste of talent and a wasted opportunity for something fun and exciting. A pic only marginally saved by its shoot-outs and fisticuffs (for the so inclined of course). Oh and what was James Caan thinking? Working for food or what? 5/10"

Here with The Cable Guy, I myself salute the internet highway and in particular the many users of IMDb who have come forth to support this most divisive of movies. Lambasted on release by regarded critics and chided by many a cinema goer who went in expecting Mask & Ace Ventura like fluff, The Cable Guy was thought to be the death knell for Carrey's career. It wasn't of course. He would revert to pleasing box office friendly type the following year with \"Liar Liar\", and would continue to surprise with his choice of roles, and the performances with them, in the likes of \"The Truman Show\", \"Man On The Moon\" & \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\". As a point of reference with his career overview, The Cable Guy stands up as a bold choice by Carrey, and one that serves notice of his willingness, and ability, to take on more challenging roles.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is a mixture of high Carrey comedy mixed with dark, almost horror undertones. The thematics of loneliness and the need for companionship makes for an odd bedfellow with the berserker antics of Carrey as he plays off of Matthew Broderick's ordinary Joe. Yet director Ben Stiller, the cop out finale aside, has achieved the cheeky fusion with much success. Utilising Carrey's energy as both a force of comic nature, and a bubbling under the surface desperado loony tune. Along the way, well before it goes real dark and gets edgy, we are treated to some delightful comedy moments. A Karaoke sequence and dinner at Medieval Times stand out, but the knowing jokes referencing movies and the TV infatuated world are also unheralded, and astute stabs of fun. Far from perfect it be, but it's a film that was badly timed, or even, misunderstood by the scribes of the time. Thank the lord for the internet for we can now find those prepared to admit they like much about The Cable Guy. Yes, I be one of those hardy souls too. 7/10"

Unfortunately Chain Reaction just comes off as being a very plain mediocre film. When I originally first saw this film I had no clue what it was about but now since seeing it with a better perspective I now know what it's about, I suppose the story in this does work well but this film does have it's problems, I'm not saying this film is bad as it's watchable but it's very plain.\r\n\r\nThe first problem in this film that comes to my mind is the music soundtrack, oh my gosh, talk about the wrong type of music for your film. Having the right music for your film is extremely important and the people that were behind the films musical design got it all completely wrong. In hindsight this is a chase film where the hero is wrongly accused of something he didn't do and is being chased by the police, but the scenes themselves are just \"plain\" and could have been better. I know I keep using the word plain but when I say this I don't mean it in a bad way, like I said the story does work well.\r\n\r\nOverall conclusion, it's a mediocre action film that's not bad but it's it's just...well...plain."

It stars Gene Hackman, Chris O'Donnell, Faye Dunnaway, Lela Rochon and Robert Prosky. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Ian Baker.\r\n\r\nYoung attorney Adam Hall (O'Donnell) fights to keep his Klansman grandfather, Sam Cayhall (Hackman), from the gas chamber.\r\n\r\nGrisham famously slated the film, even shouldering some of the blame himself, it's not hard to see why. It's a legal drama without any drama, it plods aimlessly along, getting by on Hackman's fully committed performance. At times it forgets its legal duties and gets wrapped up in family strife, which would be OK if this aspect of the story had anything worthwhile to say, it doesn't, and you can see the cast and director straining to make a two hour talkathon worthy of your time. It isn't, sadly, making it the poorest Grisham adaptation to screen. 5/10"

Meanwhile the marshal becomes suspicious of some of his coworkers. James Caan and Robert Pastorelli are on hand.  \r\n\r\n\"Eraser\" (1996) is a proficient Schwarzenegger action thriller; Vanessa is beautiful, Pastorelli is amusing and Caan is effective. There\u2019s a thrilling skydiving scene and a well-done zoo sequence with crocagators. Unfortunately, the opening act failed to really pull me in with its convoluted storytelling and the \u2018final battle\u2019 sequence is dull and eye-rolling. Both Siskel & Ebert surprisingly gave this a \u2018thumbs up.\u2019 God knows why.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal, New York City, New Jersey, DC, Maryland and New Brunswick, Canada. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"

The setting of a snowy Minnesota really allows for some great isolation scenes and highlights the \"coldness\" of the motivations in the story.\r\n\r\nI think they even summarize the events at one point as \"all over a little money\", and it's spot on.\r\n\r\nI can't say that any one thing is spectacular, but everything is done so well, I honestly think this is a great example of how to shoot a movie."

So yeah probably best to watch it as a standalone b-action movie merely inspired by it than a full on remake.\r\n\r\nLaurence Fishburne is always worth seeing though and Stephen Baldwin is pretty entertaining in this one, plus smaller roles by Salma Hayek and Will Patton.\r\n\r\nIt could have had a better and stronger (characterwise) bad guy though he was pretty forgettable.\r\n\r\nBut all and all fairly entertaining, 6.5/10"

To bolster his facade, he claims his \"special\" gift is the result of a car accident that killed his wife. But what he does not count on is more people dying in the small town where he lives. As he tries to piece together the supernatural mystery of these killings, he falls in love with the wife of one of the victims and deals with a crazy FBI agent.",

            "review": "When a man's jawbone drops off it's time to reassess the situation.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson's The Frighteners is an odd blend of outright comedy and supernatural thriller, if able to get onside with that then there's a whole lot to enjoy. Plot essential has Michael J. Fox as a psychic who really can see dead people, so much so in fact that he has befriended three ghosts and makes a living out of setting up hauntings and charging people to exorcise the spirits. However, things turn decidedly deadly when he encounters a grim reaper like spirit that is killing people and putting a number on their foreheads. It seems there is a serial killing spirit on the loose.\r\n\r\nFrank Bannister (Fox) is grieving from the death of his wife and he has become a conman, this is an interesting characterisation for Fox to play and he does so with relish. Initially the pic is all about the comedy, with Bannister's interactions with the three ghosts devilishly funny. Ok, the effects work now look a bit crude, but there's a vibrancy on offer both visually and orally.\r\n\r\nCome the second third the pic shifts into a serial killer investigation and the narrative gets dark. Oh there's still fun in the mix, but Jackson and his team are toying with the very real facet of a celebrity serial killer (ebulliently played by Jake Busey). Trini Alvarado (what happened to her?) is playing what ends up as Bannister's side-kick and love interest and the pair of them are thrust into a frantic final third of a life and death battle with Busey's psychotic spirit Johnny Bartlett. Bartlett in turn is aided by mentally ill Patricia Bradley (horror icon Dee Wallace Stone), while an outrageously over the top Jeffrey Combs is in the mix as a damaged FBI agent intent on destroying bannister and all he stands for.\r\n\r\nWhen you strip it down it's a live action horror comedy cartoon, which when you look in context to Jackson's early work is not surprising. It's also not surprising that The Frighteners has become a cult movie of some standing. The bonkers plot, the close to the knuckle humour and choice narrative threads make it a fascinating viewing experience. 7.5/10"

This is actually one of the first movies by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino that I watched and from then on I pretty much became a fan of them both. So, when it came out on Blu-ray a while ago I had to get it for the collection of course.\r\n\r\nWhen I and my dear wife first watched this movie we did not really know what it was all about. We thought it was just another robbery/criminal story and the first half of the movie it is indeed \u201cjust\u201d a robbery/criminal story. It is a fairly violent one at that which should be no surprise given who it is that have their fingers in the movie.\r\n\r\nThen half way into the movie everything goes wild when the vampires enter the scene. I remember going \u201cwhat the f\u2026\u201d when I first saw it since I wasn\u2019t really expecting it to be a vampire movie at all.\r\n\r\nThe movie is quite a rollercoaster ride which bears all the trademarks, in particular lots of bizarre violence, of the Rodriguez/Tarantino couple. Needless to say this is one of my favourite cult/bizarre movies."

It stars Val Kilmer, Michael Douglas, Tom Wilkinson, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Brian McCardie and Emily Mortimer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.\r\n\r\nTsavo, Kenya and a bridge engineer teams up with an experienced professional hunter to hunt for two lions that have been attacking local construction workers.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, one should seek out the real stories that are involved in this retelling of the real instances involving the Tsavo Lions\r\n\r\nThe story itself is awash with mysticism, the lions (Ghost and Darkness) act as some sort of supernatural beings, who we are told are offing the native folk purely for pleasure. There's an odd juxtaposition with this, in that in the midst of colonialism and macho posturing, the hunters of felines are forgivable because they are defenders of mankind - even though we know that man hunts the great feline beasts for fun regardless of this particular situation.\r\n\r\nVarious stereotypes fil out the screenplay, though not as to be insulting, but you feel that the pic as first envisaged would have had more to say on political frontage and period turmoil. It basically all ends up as a creature feature, two great white hunters facing town the monstrous enemy as their very lives become perilous by the hour.\r\n\r\nThe attack sequences are nicely staged, wonderfully primal in fact, ensuring that what the pic lacks in intelligent narrative worth it makes up for with thrills and genuine nervy suspense. So with Zsigmond providing some lovely African postcard lensing, and Goldsmith adding music that powerfully bounces around the locales, the tech credits are ensuring our eyes and ears are suitably stoked.\r\n\r\nOne key character's story arc is stupidly given short shrift, annoyingly so and coming off like someone ran out of time to either write or perform something else, and the uneven feel to it all tends to gnaw away at the enjoyment factor. Yet in spite of the flaws and unfulfilled promise there's a nice old fashioned feel to it, something that seems to have engaged the movie loving public more than it does the pro critics. Interesting that. 6.5/10"

I played with them once after they continued to badger me about it, at a par 4 hole I used a putter instead of a driver to get onto the green, literally just whacked it straight and hard, I holed in 3, much to my friend's consternation!!\r\n\r\nThe purpose of that story is why I enjoyed Happy Gilmore so much, it takes fun pot shots at the sport whilst daftly proclaiming that any dude can play in his own style. This is an absolutely no brain movie of course, with a plot as daft as it sounds - a failed/angry ice-hockey player takes up golf to earn money to save his granny's house from being repossessed - and of course he becomes a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre to the golfing curates.\r\n\r\nSandler has and always will be an acquired comedy taste, making this very much one for his fans only. And truth be told this is basic Sandler where he's shouty and sweary, and he certainly improved on a filmic level from this point on. So what you gonna do? I laughed a lot, but you see I'm a Sandler fan (though there are some films of his I positively hate), it cheered me up and sometimes that's all I want from one of his movies. 7/10"

The striking score is truly excellent too.\r\n\r\nAs for the voice cast, all of those who speak for the aforementioned bring them to life splendidly. Tom Hulce does well in the lead role, while Demi Moore is very good in the role alongside Hulce. Tony Jay is menacing as the antagonist. Credit to Kevin Kline and Paul Kandel too, as well as the three who voice the gargoyles of Victor, Hugo, and Laverne.\r\n\r\nAll the songs are solid if not massively memorable, with the obvious exception of \"The Bells of Notre Dame\". It's Alan Menken's score that brings things to life dramatically, as it suits every scene - particularly the opener, which makes for enthralling viewing.\r\n\r\nThis is a very good production from 1996."

            "review": "***Troubled production is semi-coherent with some entertainment***\r\n\r\nEver wonder where Col. Kurtz would've ended up had he survived the end of \"Apocalypse Now\"? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals \u2014 the horror, the horror.\r\n\r\nThis 1996 version of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" was such a troubled production that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like the 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau.\" Stanley championed the project, wrote the screenplay and was set to direct, but was fired after a few days of filming due to conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set. \r\n\r\nActually that wasn\u2019t the main reason Stanley was fired. He was fine for small indie productions, but he was out of his league with a blockbuster like this. Veteran filmmaker John Frankenheimer was brought in to save the production from being a complete disaster. He got the job done, but his tyrannical approach didn\u2019t help matters. \r\n\r\nThe production was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the set, but was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this Brando's well-known eccentricities, not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne, and constant rewrites and you have a formula for a cinematic chaos!\r\n\r\nIn light of the horrible production and the ensuing bad press you would think this would be a lousy movie, but it's actually not THAT bad. I can see why some people don't like it because parts of the third act are pretty crazy and don't flow very well, but if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the mood & insanity of films like \"Apocalypse Now\" and the original \"Planet of the Apes\" (\"It's a madhouse, a MADHOUSE!\") you'll probably appreciate some of it. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of either of those films, but comparisons are inevitable and there are entertaining bits.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the story isn't that compelling; the flow of the movie is off, which is mostly apparent in the mounting craziness of the final third, which tempts the viewer to tune out. \r\n\r\nThankfully, there are some positives. The title sequence is kinetic and dazzling; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal; the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); there\u2019s some creative pizazz, like Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint where he\u2019s as captivating as always, albeit a fat bastage; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's \"Mini-Me\" is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are flashes of nigh greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.\r\n\r\nMarlon's Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz, i.e. nutjob in the jungle, albeit twenty years later. For Brando fans it's enjoyable seeing him in his old age. This was one of his final films and it shows that he had his magnetic charm \u2019til the end.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are some interesting themes: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's abode are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal 'village' in the forest; the most human-like one, Aissa, he even refers to as his daughter. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? Moreover, while Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictators are rarely good. When Hyena-Swine usurps the crown he immediately becomes a malevolent dictator.\r\n\r\nThe original version runs 96 minutes and the DC 99 minutes. The film was shot in Cairns, Queensland, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+\r\n"

A meteorite crashes near the station transforming the woman into an alien being with a gigantic voracious tongue and her poodles are transformed into four drag queens. The whole thing grows even weirder as her boy friend escapes from prison and also encounters the meteorite, as does a mute Nun who is converted into a sexy drum majorette. Pursued by the prison officials who are after him, the whole group eventually come into conflict.",

If you can get past that or roll with it, this is a decent story of redemption with some laughs augmented by the road-movie plot. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in Pennsylvania (Mars, Rochester & Pittsburgh), Nevada (Reno) and New York (Webster).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

            "review": "And like Jericho, Walls come tumbling down.\r\n\r\nLast Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern.\r\n\r\nWalter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration.\r\n\r\nThe look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen.\r\n\r\nIt's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10"

What we get here is four Doug Kinney's, each one having their own driving personality to make it real easy for the audience to distinguish which is which. So, with Michael Keaton delivering four excellent performances as the Dougs, the comic relief flows pretty much all through the picture.\r\n\r\nHowever, director Harold Ramis is guilty of staying safe with the material to hand because from the off the conclusion is never in doubt, the feel good factor is evident even as the Dougs are chaotically imploding. But is that really a reason to do the film down? Well no as far as I'm concerned, Multiplicity is a tidy fusion of sci-fi comedy and romance that isn't taking the science literally.\r\n\r\nFor Doug number 4 alone, with his skiing skills and pizza fetish, this film deserves 7/10, whilst Keaton deserves a far higher score indeed."

            "review": "Alcatraz. Only one man has ever broken out. Now five million lives depend on two men breaking in.\r\n\r\nMichael Bay's best picture.\r\n\r\nThe sophomore effort from director Michael Bay, this $75 million dollar action film was released nationwide on June 7, 1996 - eventually earning $335 million. The particularly great R-rated premise sees a mild-mannered chemist teaming up with a resourceful ex-con who must infiltrate Alcatraz prison after a rogue group of military men, led by a renegade general, threaten a nerve-gas attack.\r\n\r\nConstantly in over his head, and never one to use profane language, Nicholas Cage is excellent as the quirky chemist - often resorting to quips and jokes in lieu of violence. In a character that feels like a sort of spiritual successor to his portrayal of James Bond, Sean Connery is the patient but skilled MI6 operative.\r\n\r\nAfter 30-years of false imprisonment, he's recruited from jail to help the feds sneak onto Alcatraz - as he's the only person to have successfully escaped from the prison facility decades earlier. When he's required to finally put his knowledge of the defunct prison to the test, the disbelief and amazement from his military companions is quite amusing.\r\n\r\nThe unlikely pairing of these two is honestly the best part of the film. Cage's zany behavior is a perfect foil for Connery's relaxed confidence. The British ex-con chastises his younger counterpart on 'doing his best'. \"Your'best'? Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and -bang- the prom queen.\" After a quick beat and a sly grin, Nicholas responds, \"Carla was the prom queen.\" This isn't just a funny encapsulation of their relationship, but one of my all-time favorite exchanges in any action movie.\r\n\r\nEd Harris is phenomenal as the quote, \"bad guy\" - a disillusioned Marine General whose terrorist actions are only to secure reparations for his forgotten and fallen soldiers. It's honestly a perfectly understandable, and dare I say noble position; a man willing to commit treason and risk his life to help the families of his former troops.\r\n\r\nWhich is why the government's handling, and ultimate dismissal of his ransom request is so perplexing and frustrating. Before ordering a massive aerial kill strike on the entire island, the President gives an impassioned speech (seemingly to an empty Oval Office) about his 'impossible decision' - but this only highlights the aforementioned plot hole. Harris only asked for $100 million dollars... why not just give him the money?\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is stacked with even more excellent talent; David Morse, William Forsythe, Michael Beihn, Xander Berkeley, and Phillip Baker Hall. Of particular note however is John Spencer - who does fantastic work as a conflicted FBI director who reluctantly recruits Connery, Tony Todd who has one of the best on-screen deaths ever, and John C. McGinley whose unrealistic performance as an over-eager Marine makes him seem miscast.\r\n\r\nA trio of composers, including Hans Zimmer, bring some interesting and appropriate ideas to the soundtrack, utilizing synthesized themes and electric guitars. It feels reminiscent of the excellent score from the \"Rainbow Six\" video game that came out two years later.\r\n\r\nWhile this feature never quite breaks the mold, it definitely represents the best possible version of your stereotypical mid-90s action film. For a rewatchable thrill-ride with plenty of excitement and memorable characters, look no further. \"The Rock\" is explosive fun that never takes itself too seriously. Perhaps Bay's best film, I thought it was AWESOME."

Hortense is shocked to find that it is Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), not just white but living in near-poverty and wallowing in regret. Cynthia has a tumultuous relationship with her acknowledged daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), who she fears to be repeating her own youthful mistakes. Cynthia also finds its hard to relate to her brother Maurice (Timothy Spall) and his cold wife Monica (Phyllis Logan), who have done well from a photo shop business. Hortense's entry into this family ultimately shatters their miserable status quo, but not without some heartbreak on the way.\r\n\r\nAt this point in his career, Mike Leigh had perfected a filmmaking technique by which he had his actors live out their roles in everyday situations in the street for weeks before he started shooting. Consequently, by the time these actors were captured on film, they are totally convincing as their characters, and the characters are fleshed out through the little details that Leigh allowed to bring to them in improvising. The viewer feels that he knows these people deeply. Leigh also has a way of mixing pathos and humour. He not only will insert a comedic shot after a poignant one, but he'll then present ambiguous images where the viewer is unsure whether he should laugh or cry.\r\n\r\nWhile the acting and that dash of humour is quite powerful, there are elements that hold me back from universally praising this film. I've never been impressed by Leigh's use of music, which feels cheap, and only one shot (a deftly timed outdoor barbecue) was truly impressive in its mis-en-sc\u00e8ne. And I find Leigh's previous film Naked a slightly more successful application of his art. Still, the acting in SECRETS AND LIES is really something, and I would generally recommend this film."

            "review": "***Justifiable execution and justifiable lying***\r\n\r\n\u201cSleepers\u201d (1991) starts out as a coming-of-age film about four boys in 1966-1967 from Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Manhattan, and then morphs into a juvenile prison picture, which covers the first hour. The rest of the movie is a crime tragedy turned courtroom drama, taking place 13 years later in the early 80s. Jason Patric plays the adult version of Shakes, the main protagonist and narrator, while Brad Pitt plays his attorney friend, Michael. When their other two buds, John and Tommy, are taken into custody for murder they hatch a plan to get them off for understandable reasons. Robert De Niro plays their Catholic pastor and father-figure while Dustin Hoffman appears as the dubious defense attorney. Kevin Bacon is on hand as a perverse guard at the boys\u2019 reformatory.\r\n\r\nIn an eye-rolling knee-jerk response, liberal critics have dissed the film as \u201chomophobic\u201d when this isn\u2019t the case at all. For verification, if the victims at the reformatory were girls the baseless criticism wouldn\u2019t even be mentioned. It is not about gender; it is about children and the monstrous abuse of authority for selfish purposes. The film NEVER criticizes what two adults CHOOSE to do behind closed doors.\r\n\r\nIn tone and theme, \u201cSleepers\u201d is similar to the heralded \u201cMystic River\u201d (2003), but more episodic in nature and therefore not as dramatically compelling. Yet it\u2019s a poignant crime drama. Some have panned the movie on the grounds that it justifies revenge murder, but it more clearly supports the idea of just execution when legal authorities have failed and allowed gross corruption to continue.\r\n\r\nAnother moral issue revolves around lying. Is it ever right to lie for the sake of justice? In other words, is lying ever justifiable? Of course it is; at least on rare occasions. For instance, in the bible the midwives lied to Pharaoh in order to save Hebrew infants and are commended for fearing God (Exodus 1:15-21). Rahab also lied to save the two Hebrew spies in Jericho and her actions are hailed in Hebrews 11, the Hall of Faith chapter. During WW2, if Nazi authorities came to your door looking for hidden Jews, would you say \u201cYes, I cannot lie; they are hiding in the attic\u201d? Of course you wouldn\u2019t.      \r\n\r\nThe script by director Barry Levinson was based on a book by Lorenzo Carcaterra, which is supposedly a true story. Although New York authorities have denied its authenticity, they have good reason to do so. Whether or not every jot & tittle is accurate is irrelevant; stories LIKE IT have happened.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes and was shot in New York City & surrounding areas (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Yonkers, Hoboken) and Fairfield Hills Hospital, Newtown, Connecticut (Wilkinson School for Boys). ADDITIONAL CAST: Minnie Driver plays the guys\u2019 friend from their youth while Vittorio Gassman is on hand as a nonchalant mob leader in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

He makes friends with a boy & his mother (Natalie Canerday) and they let him live in their garage, but the mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend presents a problem (Dwight Yoakam). John Ritter is on hand as the mother\u2019s gay best friend. \r\n\r\n\"Sling Blade\" (1996) is a small town drama with a memorable central character (if I didn\u2019t know beforehand that Thornton played the role, I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him). The characters and their situations smack of real life while the unhurried story is interesting enough. There are well-done moments of meditation and revelation, as well as touching ones.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tad overlong, however, and the politically correct glorification of Vaughan (Ritter) is eye-rolling. Karl (Thornton) observes that \u201cThe Bible says two men ought not lay together. But I don't reckon the Good Lord would send anybody like you to Hades.\u201d Yet his opining doesn\u2019t mean much since he candidly acknowledges elsewhere that he doesn\u2019t understand a lot of the Scriptures, not to mention his foolish predilection for murder to solve mundane problems. He should stick to fixing lawnmowers and eating them French fried potaters, mmm-hmm.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Benton & nearby Haskell, Arkansas, which are about 20-30 minutes southwest of Little Rock.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

The basketball scenes are great, the jokes mostly land, and Bill Murray steals the show whenever he's onscreen. Not to mention the fantastic soundtrack that today is pure standard. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a serious movie, Space Jam isn't your thing. If you want a fun family movie that makes you laugh and cheer on the greatest basketball star of all time, then this is definitely worth your time."

            "review": "_**Solid Next Generation Trek film with The Borg**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 1996 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, \"Star Trek: First Contact\" features The Next Generation characters taking on the Borg, a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones in a hive-mind called the Collective. In order to escape imminent destruction by the Federation, a Borg mini-ship flees back in time to 2063 to prevent the renowned Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) from accomplishing the initial warp drive and the subsequent first contact with an alien race, which later paved the way for the Federation of Planets. Alfre Woodard has a key role as a colleague of Cochrane.\r\n\r\nThe Borg are an excellent villain and one of the greatest contributions of The Next Generation TV series, along with all its elaboration on Klingon culture. Here the Borg are augmented by the introduction of a Queen (Alice Krige), which some feel detracted from the impersonal and eerie race while others think enhanced them. It makes no difference to me personally, but it fits the parallel of a queen bee in a honey bee colony. Besides, why wouldn\u2019t there be a central intelligence?\r\n\r\nThere are some gems to mine from the proceedings, like Cochrane's revelation of his carnal motivations for developing warp drive and Picard's hell-bent desire to annihilate the Borg. Speaking of Picard, Patrick Stewart carries the film with his unique star power, which is very different from Shatner, but just as effective.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, The Next Generation TV series never developed a prominent triumvirate like Kirk/Spock/McCoy, but rather a dyad, Picard and Data. Whereas this duo was core to the previous TNG film, \"Generations\" (1994) and the last one, \"Nemesis\" (2002), it's not as evident here until the last act when Picard attempts to rescue the charismatic android, but that's only because they get separated early on and Data ends up hanging out with the Borg Queen. By the way, Picard's self-sacrificial desire to save Data reveals a weakness in the script: After the Enterprise is set to self-destruct, Picard only has 15 MINUTES to rescue Data and escape the ship, but Picard is shown having a meaningful discussion with Lily (Woodard). Why sure! \r\n\r\nAnother gem of the film is the revelation of the alien race at the end, which prompts a \"Wow\" reaction to fans of Star Trek (although erudite Trekkers undoubtedly knew what was coming).\r\n\r\nThere are other flaws, like the jarring, contrived excuse for going back in time and the questionable fiery confrontation between Picard and Lily. I say \"questionable\" because something about the sequence renders it somewhat shaky; it may be the acting, the writing or some combination, but they needed to work out the kinks. Still, that scene has some good aspects, like Picard's line: \"The line must be drawn HERE!\" and the build-up to it.\r\n\r\nWhile I favor 1994's \"Generations\" to \"First Contact\" because of the fascinating story elements, e.g. the Nexus, and the potent subtext (see my review), and even marginally prefer the underrated \"Nemesis\" (2002), this doesn't take away from the fact that \"First Contact\" is a quality installment in the series, which gets better with repeat viewings despite its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs almost 111 minutes and was shot in the studio with location shooting at Angeles National Forest and Green Valley, Arizona (substituting for Montana).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Well, that\u2019s a load of bullshit! Sure it was very American but given the name and the cast, what the hell did these morons expect? If one cannot enjoy a good American action movie because of some patriotism in it, well then do not watch them! Incidentally there are some countries in Europe, no names mentioned cough cough, that could do with some more patriotism in the first place. Anyway, for us it was two enjoyable hours and hey, it's Harrison Ford after all! It is a decent enough transfer to Blu-ray although the choice of sound codecs is a bit unusual in that it has a Linear PCM 5.1 English track on it."

This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M. Dwyer) takes the breath away. Yet come the final straight it loses its way, sinking into a mire of over confidence, topped by a crown of thorns involving an albino baby alien hybrid. Shame that. 6.5/10"

And why did Jon Voight not win another Oscar for this movie?\r\n\r\n\u201cAnaconda\u201d follows a group of highly intelligent and not at all oblivious documentary filmmakers as they search for a hidden tribe in the Amazon. Along the way, they find a not at all creepy snake hunter played by Jon Voight, whose tries to help them but completely by accident takes them into a forbidden area of the Amazon where resides giant, completely realistic-looking snakes that move at entirely believable and not at all unrealistic speeds. Trust me, you won\u2019t believe how realistic the CGI is. You\u2019d swear the snakes were right there with the actors.\r\n\r\nThe characters are in no way infuriating. At no point do you ever root for the snakes to win and all the human characters to die in horrible ways. You feel genuinely upset when a character dies and don\u2019t want to laugh or cheer at all.\r\n\r\nTrust me, you need to see this movie. It\u2019s easily on par with such masterpieces as \u201cThe Room\u201d or Kirk Cameron\u2019s \u201cSaving Christmas.\u201d"

Doesn't stop it from being terrible, but does make it worth watching.\r\n\r\nJoel Schumacher delivers us the final nail in the lid of Batman's coffin with none other than George Clooney in the guise of the Caped Crusader, probably the worst on screen Batman we'll ever see. Clooney was actually a pretty inspired choice if you're thinking solely about the billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, but ask any Batfan and they'll tell you: the character's true identity is Batman, Bruce Wayne is just a mask he wears.\r\n\r\nFinally, this isn't a real complaint but something that I'm going to address anyway: The Batman movie with Batman and Robin is called _Batman Forever_, but the one with Batman, Robin and Batgirl is called just _Batman & Robin_? Go figure.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

The various local people they meet who initially seem helpful are in fact criminals working together. The wife is kidnapped, the husband is told to pay half a million to get her back alive, and Kurt Russell decides he'd rather fight.\r\n\r\nI found this a rather lame movie. Its believability goes way down when, for example, Kurt Russell rides on the bottom of a moving truck trailer and easily finds his way up to the cab. There are obvious continuity and other errors here: a villain gets a brutal rifle blast to his shoulder, but a few minutes later he's driving a car with no visible problems; a small child is shown playing video games (so it's early evening), but a few minutes later in the same scene dawn breaks.\r\n\r\nAbout the only entertainment here is the acting of J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey, who are caricatures but fun ones. Kurt Russell, on the other hand, acts like he's not particularly happy to have taken this role, and is just going through the motions until he gets his paycheck.\r\n\r\nI must say that the purported message, if any, of this film is intriguing. <i>Breakdown</i> seems to be suggesting that decent people from the coasts shouldn't venture into flyover country, since it is the den of rednecks who lie in wait for them. The forces behind this film clearly weren't interested in fairly portraying the Midwest."

She surprisingly agrees to go along with the charade of being his wife to fool his nutty parents. His sole ambition seems to be to kill a field goal kicker for the Bills who let him down five years earlier. Anjelica Huston, Mickey Rourke, Jan-Michael Vincent and Rosanna Arquette have brief roles.\r\n\r\n\u201cBuffalo \u201966\u201d (1998) is an offbeat indie written & directed by its star, Gallo. I only know him from Coppola\u2019s \u201cTetro\u201d (2009) where he proved to have an almost Brando-like charisma (I said \u201calmost\u201d). Ricci is one of the highlights here as she\u2019s petite, voluptuous and adorable. Unfortunately, most of the episodes in the story could\u2019ve been cut by one-third or even one-half. As it is, they become tedious, such as the loong segment at the parent\u2019s house. But the final act wins the day with Yes\u2019 \u201cHeart of the Sunrise\u201d placed strategically and a profound moral about the power of uncompromising love to change a piece of sheet.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York, and surround areas (Gowanda, Lackawanna and Woodlawn).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

The fact that I do like Nicolas Cage, even though he is at times really lousy at choosing which movies he participate in, is of course an additional plus.\r\n\r\nNaturally I do like the performance of Nicolas Cage in this movie but John Malkowich is also great as the main bad guy and Steve Buscemi is perfect as the nutcase although his role could have been a bit more expanded upon. The rest of the actors are doing nicely as well although it always saddens me to see Colm Meaney playing a dumbass and/or bad guy after his role in Star Trek.\r\n\r\nThe story is not really bad although it has the usual Hollywood mistakes here and there. The ease by which they pick locks in this high security flight is somewhat laughable and I seriously doubt that they would have been able to haul the plane out of that desert junkyard in flyable condition in real life for instance. Still, it is not a bad story and it works for moving the movie forward.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of action and it is mostly quite entertaining. Sometimes it is a bit silly and rather unrealistic of course but, as I wrote, mostly it is quite entertaining. The ending is definitely a bit on the silly side with the plane touching down on the Las Vegas Strip. This bit felt like the producers realized that they had some FX budget left and just had to burn it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, on the whole a quite entertaining movie."

It's intelligent, well-acted and directed, and the special effects it has HELPS the story rather than IMPEDES it. Though she hasn't done much lately, either in the director's chair or acting, Jodie Foster is one of my favourite contemporary American actresses, and it's intriguing how her great talent's been utilized of late (ie., 'Elysium', and I'm still very mad at Spike Lee for having Christopher Plummer call her a 'cunt' in 'Inside Man').\r\n\r\nPersonally, I must admit that I myself have worried what other worlds' inhabitants would think of our civilization from the messages it might get from Earth. Though I thankfully haven't lost any sleep over it (I have 'Thumper' in the apartment above me to thank for that), as Led Zeppelin would say in the classic 'Stairway to Heaven', '...and it makes me wonder'.\r\n\r\nAs what happens in most of these movies, it's rather anticlimactic once the different cultures meet. I'll say to my dying day that the most difficult thing to do in cinema is end a film. Here (unlike perfect sci-fi masterpieces, like '2001: A Space odyssey' or the more recent 'Children of Men') the decent but otherwise unspectacular ending makes me avoid a perfect rating here. But it's awfully close, worth both owning and rewatching, and provides fairly early evidence (which would come to bold fruition in 'Killer Joe') that Matthew McConaughey could actually act. It's also a tossup between this, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Back to the Future' for my favourite Zemeckis moment."

Time passes so slow in a quiet little town of \u201cCop Land\u201d. This bulky sheriff does nothing other than controlling traffic and surrendering to his pinball addiction. When a misfire broke out in town, Freddy jumped into it with the help of Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro). This seems like a big leap of the career-stuck sheriff. Two thumbs of for Stallone for giving up his all muscles body, something is well-maintained for years and also his choice for accepting a role much different from his usual heroic/action ones. Stallone did much better in his role when compared to his acting in Get Carter or D-Tox"

            "review": "This review is of the Director's Cut.\r\n\r\nWelcome To Shell Beach. \r\n\r\nDark City is directed by Alex Proyas who also co-writes the screenplay with Leon Dobbs and David S. Goyer. It stars Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien and Ian Richardson. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. \r\n\r\nA man wakes up in a grotty hotel bathroom and upon finding a dead girl in another room he realises he has no recollection of who he is or how he got there... \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of Blade Runner fans still out there waiting for that film's sexual partner to happen along. What many of them don't realise is that Alex Proyas has already made that movie. More than a cult film yet still criminally ignored in certain circles, Dark City, by way of poor box office and studio interference, never got off to the best of starts. The problems were compounded with the release of The Matrix the following year, where that film's popularity, and its sci-fi linkage to Dark City, led many to think that Proyas' movie was a Matrix rip-off; pushing it further (unjustly) back in the sci-fi noir pantheon. Fact is is that Dark City homages much great cinema from previous years, but it has influenced much that followed, with Inception fans asked to note that Nolan himself was taking notes... \r\n\r\nStolen Memories. \r\n\r\nDark City is a feverish film noir dressed up in stunning sci-fi clothes. The amazing visuals have led many to state that it's a film with much style and little substance, something which Proyas has fiercely argued against; and he's right to do so, especially once his own preferred director's cut became available to view. The story is a complex one, pulsing with human characters living in a world where there is no daylight, with their respective memories scratchy to say the least, it quickly becomes evident that a creepy alien race are overseeing things. The aliens, wonderfully attired in black trench-coats and hats to match, and aided by Kiefer Sutherland's shifty - stammer affected - doctor, have special powers and their reasons for being here unfold in deftly constructed stages. One man stands in their way, John Murdoch (Sewell), but he is an olde noir amnesia sufferer supreme and his battle to unravel what is going on is our task as well. \r\n\r\nDo you think about the past much Mrs. Murdoch? \r\n\r\nThe search for identity and the truth is what propels the picture forward. Murdoch in his confused state is not only at the center of an existential dilemma, he's also the focal point for a serial killer murder investigation. This also as he tries to come to terms with matters of the heart, it seems he has a beautiful wife (Connelly), and that she may have cheated on him? And why is he drawn to the place known as Shell Beach? A simple narrative hidden by visual splendours? Don't make me laugh! But hell you have to say the visual look and atmosphere of the design is very much attention grabbing. \r\n\r\nI have become the monster you were intended to be. \r\n\r\nWith the film noir characters in place; Hurt's dour sleuth, Sewell's amnesiac and Connelly's sultry torch singer, Proyas brings German expressionism in abundance whilst overseeing an eye splintering neo-noir colour palette. Greens and reds often ping from the screen, while the murky browns and golds down on the angular city streets pave the way for changed perceptions and revelations of plotting. There are reoccurring motifs throughout, with swirls and circles integral to mood and meanings, while at the mid-point we then get to see Proyas' tricks of the trade, where the city shifts and moves to create a meeting of Metropolis and Gotham, all as the humans slumber away. Watch those clocks folks... \r\n\r\nYou know how I was supposed to feel. That person isn't me... never was. You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human. Well, you're not going to find it... \r\n\r\nActing performances are hardly top of the line (Sutherland especially irritates more than he impresses), but they actually don't need to be, and they all look terrific in their respective dressage. The story is of course bonkers and one which I myself found was much better whilst consuming mucho alcohol! (I watched it three times in 48 hours!) While Proyas himself is on record as saying it's a far from flawless picture. Again he is right, but he also knows that his film is still under valued and in need of more to seek out his director's cut. The late Roger Ebert championed Dark City with much gusto, and he provides very good input on the DVD, much like Roger I have to say, this is a unique and fabulous sci-fi noir experience. A film in fact fit to watch alongside Blade Runner; And I do not say that lightly. 9/10"

Apparently some strange sea creatures have run amok and the pirates themselves are now next on the menu! \r\n\r\n\"Deep Rising\" doesn't have any delusion about what it wants to be, it was marketed as a raging \"B\" movie man versus beast gun fest, and that is exactly what it is - with tongue firmly in its bloody cheek. When the tag line reads \"Full Scream Ahead\" then you get the impression it's not a film to be remotely taken seriously. \r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Stephen Sommers (\"The Mummy\"), \"Deep Rising\" is a blend of \"Alien\", \"Poseidon Adventure\" and \"Under Siege\", all built around the \"Ten Little Indians\" structure. Blood spurts and quips are dealt, and the film isn't found wanting in the good old \"it's behind you\" department. The cast give it the full gusto histrionics, Treat Williams, the sumptuous Famke Jansen (holding her own surrounded by hundreds of pounds of testosterone), Anthony Heald, Kevin J O'Connor, Wes Studi, Djimon Hounsou and, erm, Jason Flemyng also star. \r\n\r\nIt's a mini riot out at sea, great great fun. 7/10"

            "review": "In the year 2040, a spacecraft called the Event Horizon was sent out to journey among the stars with an experimental gravity drive that purported to allow faster-than-light travel. On its maiden voyage, however, it vanished. Seven years later, it has returned, orbiting Neptune, and a rescue crew is sent out to investigate, along with the scientist responsible for the ship\u2019s creation. The rescue crew of the Lewis and Clark are a group of no-nonsense blue-collar workers, led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), with Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) along for his expertise. When they arrive at the Event Horizon, they find the crew long dead. \u201cThis ship is a tomb,\u201d judges Captain Miller at one point. The rescue team begins to realize that the ship passed through a black hole created by the gravity drive, but didn\u2019t return alone. The ship with a long-dead crew shows life signs. The rescue team begins to have terrifying visions. The gravity drive begins to spin of its own accord...\r\n\r\nSomething is loose on the ship, and the rescue team has to not only unravel out what happened to the original crew, but also protect themselves from the horrors that returned with the ship. It\u2019s a simple but sturdy setup, standard B-movie stuff. What elevates Event Horizon is its first-class production design and solid atmosphere. Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Alien vs. Predator) is not a name one would generally associate with good film product these days, but here he managed (in spite of himself, one may think given the rest of his output) to present a film steeped in suspense, with strong performances, gorgeous set pieces, and palpable horror.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest: there\u2019s nothing new here. The strength of this film lies in how it fits together the pieces it stole from other films. This is very much (and very completely) The Shining by way of Alien, even to the point of lifting the character archetypes directly from Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 masterpiece. The Event Horizon is the Overlook Hotel, teeming with supernatural power and malice. The film delves into gore in its last third, but it\u2019s not quite proficient enough to have it enhance the scares (which were doing just fine before the blood started flowing so freely). However, the film is even structured like Alien and The Shining, all slow burn and building dread until things begin to go to hell (literally, perhaps). The cast have stock characters but they bring them to life admirably, particularly Neill and Fishburne; among the secondary characters, Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Noseworthy, and Sean Pertwee are particularly memorable. The script by Philip Eisner is derivative but effective, and Anderson was clearly at the peak of his directorial prowess here. Don't misunderstand me to say that the film's lifts from other works make it bad; it's certainly not. Originality is overrated as an attribute, and fairly value-neutral even on the best of days. I'd much rather have a tale well-told than one that does weird things simply for the sake of doing weird things (French sci-fi/fantasy directors, I'm looking at you. Yes, you, Jeunet), though the greatest films find a way to combine both sturdy storytelling and originality in the medium. In total, Event Horizon is a very effective sci-fi horror film, breaking no new ground but doing what it does very well. A minor classic of the sci-fi horror genre."

            "review": "It's like looking in a mirror, only, not.\r\n\r\nThere's a tendency to undervalue the action movie. Certainly there's a wide expanse of land in cinema world where film fans reside, where the thought of praising an action film for being \"classic\" cinema is considered treason against the very word. Yet some of the artistry involved in the genre's leading lights is purely sublime, regardless of how bizarre and unlikely the plot is. Enter John Woo's berserker, ear splitting, high octane actioner, Face/Off. Rightly sitting along side the likes of Die Hard and Predator as genre pieces that showcase how good things can be when it all comes together, Woo's movie is as much fun as you could wish to have for over two hours of explosive, fantastical, unadulterated cinema.\r\n\r\nThe plot sees John Travolta's serious family man cop, Sean Archer, devote his life to catching unbalanced maniacal bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). There's some bad history between the two and when Archer manages to capture both Troy and his equally vile brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), it would seem to be closure for Archer and his family. However, it's found that the Troy's have left a ticking bomb somewhere in Los Angeles, and if undetected it will flatten L.A. and kill practically everyone. So, Archer undergoes a revolutionary face-swapping procedure with the now comatose Castor and sets about getting the information from the incarcerated Pollux. But wait!, Castor wakes up and turns the tables by assuming Archer's identity, setting the wheels in motion for each man to live the others life until the Face/Off between the pair will decide their respective fate.\r\n\r\nUnbelievable? Of course. Who cares? Well nobody should really, because surely going into a film like this one is expecting the ludicrous. Both Cage and Travolta are superbly realising the spectacular nature of the script, and being mesmerising in the duality of the roles into the bargain. Make no bones about it, Woo and his team have crafted a benchmark action movie. There's a trail of thought that suggests that Woo basically keeps making the same movie, that's a fair enough point, sure enough, all of his staple action sequences and traits are evident in Face/Off. Yet Woo has delved into his characters, given them some flesh on their action bones, and then upped the anti in action set pieces to cloak them in chaotic beauty. From the opening Jet escape/pursuit set up, to the outrageous speed boat finale, the film is one long exhilarating breath taker. Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain & Nick Cassavetes all file into the background playing important characters who are rightly secondary to the protagonists, while a ream of extras come and go as each are dispatched in a hail of Woo inspired carnage. The pace never sags and the eyes and ears are treated to a vibrancy that is often sadly missing from many other big budgeted action blockbusters.\r\n\r\nThis is a masterpiece of action cinema, so even as a Orson Welles crane shot is a magnificent thing, so it be with the sight of two stunt men flailing thru the air in a spray of exploding water. Oh yes sir, this is a classic alright. 10/10"

They will do a one off show where they themselves will strip on the stage, with the difference being that this lot will go for the \"Full Monty\" - totally naked dancing!\r\n\r\nThe Full Monty is a very winning comedy, it's preposterous in premise of course, but in amongst the frivolity and outright daftness, lies a very clever and functional tale of personal relationships. In spite of what some American reviewers have said over the years, the picture is awash with very funny gags, it's just perhaps that the untrained none British eye isn't seeing the jokes? For instance, during the famous dole queue dancing sequence, have a look at the guy standing behind Tom Wilkinson, who after witnessing Wilkinson do his Fred Astaire act, merely puffs out his cheeks and carries on waiting his turn! It's little touches like that that say so much about the divide between British and American comedy.\r\n\r\nAs I alluded to earlier, The Full Monty isn't just a comedy about unsightly men doing a strip tease. We have a group of men who each strive for something in their lives, be it the strain of home life or sexual identity, these guys are given sensitive emotional themes from which to regain some dignity. If there is a criticism here, then it would have been nice to give the female characters a bit more flesh on their bones, but ultimately this really is about the boys after all. Backed up by a foot tapping soundtrack and boasting excellent performances from the cast, The Full Monty is a hugely enjoyable picture that rewards on repeat viewings. So just keep your eyes peeled for sight gags you just may have missed the last time you viewed it. 8/10"

Jane is directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra. It stars Demi Moore, Vigo Mortensen, Anne Bancroft, Jason Beghe, John Michael Higgins and Kevin Gage. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Hugh Johnson.\r\n\r\nA female Senator succeeds in enrolling a woman into Combined Reconnaissance Team training (Navy Seals) where everyone expects her to fail.\r\n\r\nHaving made a telling feminist mark with his excellent Thelma and Louise in 1991, Ridley Scott picks up the lady baton once again only to drop it half way through. This is a film of confused messages, what starts out as a worthwhile story involving a woman trying to overcome extreme prejudices in one of America's elite fighting forces, ends up as a gung-ho hoorah movie with Jane having \"manned\" up.\r\n\r\nThings aren't helped by the sheer ridiculousness of the treatment meted out to Jane by her superior in training, Master Chief John James Urgayle (Mortensen suitably vile), so much so you would like to think if that sort of stuff goes on then arrests should be made. Daftness also comes by way of the superior officers prancing around training camp in the world's tightest shorts, one would think they must be on their way to \"The Blue Oyster Bar\"...\r\n\r\nThings are further compounded by the fact that as committed as Moore is in the title role, and she is and gives it her all, one can't buy into the characterisation because you simply are watching Demi Moore the actress. Shaved head and beefed up she may be, but this is still one of the highest paid actresses of her era, the characterisation thin on the ground with no depth. The political machinations at work barely get time to breath in fact the key mid-point tonal political shift is given short shrift.\r\n\r\nStylisation as one would expect from Scott, is super, as is his control of top draw action sequences. But the cock-eyed view of a woman in a man's world is hard to swallow, and although it mostly entertains, it's ultimately a shallow exercise. 5/10"

Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is an in-valid who assumes the identity of a disabled valid (Jude Law) in order to fulfill his dream of space travel. Uma Thurman and Gore Vidal are also on hand.\r\n\r\n\"Gattaca\" (1997) is a sci-fi drama \u201ctech noir,\u201d which combines futuristic science-fiction with 40s/50s noir. \r\nIt\u2019s not just the suits & hats, the cars look like 50s/60s coupes, but whine because they\u2019re electric. It\u2019s similar in this respect to \u201cDark City\u201d (1998), but more dramatic. Imagine if \u201cDick Tracy\u201d (1990) was a somber space-age sci-fi and you\u2019d have a pretty good idea. \r\n\r\nThe film flopped at the box office while critics generally praised it. It plays better if you have an interest in eugenics and the philosophies thereof. For me, it\u2019s decent, but too low-key.

Captured by the wild man, it doesn\u2019t take long for the heiress from San Francisco (Leslie Mann) to see that George is a better man than her arrogant, condescending fianc\u00e9 (Thomas Hayden Church). \r\n\r\n\u201cGeorge of the Jungle\u201d (1997) is an over-the-top spoof of Tarzan inspired by the 60\u2019s cartoon which I\u2019ve never seen. You have to be able to appreciate fun, goofy humor to enjoy this quirky family comedy/adventure. It helps that Fraser is both likable and amusing in the eponymous role (I should add that he really inspires guys to improve their fitness). Meanwhile Mann is as sweet & beautiful as Bernadette Peters in her prime. Everything clicks for great entertainment; I laughed through practically the whole flick.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Kaua'I & Maui, Hawaii, and the San Francisco Bay area, California, as well as other parts of that state (Middle Fork American River, Stockton & Los Angeles). \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

It stars Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto, R. Lee Ermey, Ted Levine and William Fitchner. Music is by Basil Poledouris and cinematography by Oliver Wood.\r\n\r\nFBI agent Frank LaCrosse (Quaid) is tracking a serial killer who he believes kidnapped his young son.\r\n\r\nSwitchback is a standard serial killer based thriller that flopped at the box office. It's not a bad film but it never delivers on its potential. The location travelogue of the story is most impressive, especially the last third once we get to the snowy mountains of Colorado, but it's the scenery that grips and holds the attention more than the plot.\r\n\r\nThe red herrings have interest value enough for us to stay with what is at just under two hours a long film, but resolutions are either anti climatic or too obvious. Cast are a mixed bag, with Quaid just okay as the perpetually bleak protag and Glover sadly winding out as miscast once film shows its hands. Thankfully Leto and Ermey are on hand to keep a rein on things, playing the intended thriller tone just right as per their respective characters.\r\n\r\nIt's perhaps unlucky to have followed far superior/intelligent serial killer based thrillers, rendering it then and now as weak offerings. It's not the dead on stinker the box office suggests, and trimmed of 20 minutes it would have been a decent time waster, but as it is it plays out as unoriginal and lacking in directorial focus. 5/10"

He is happy with his lot, shuns commitment and his best form of defence is attack both physically and verbally against those who want to impose their will on him for better or worse.\r\n\r\nAt the same university a professor of mathematics throws out a complex mathematical challenge to his students, asking them to complete the formula on a blackboard in the hall outside of his classroom. Will is cleaning floors one morning, comes across the blackboard and within seconds he has completed the formula before carrying on his duties while the professor wonders who it was!\r\n\r\nIt turns out Will was abused in his youth, and has moved on from one foster family to the next, but none of them were seemingly any better, and never reached out to his needs leaving him feeling bitter and angry.\r\n\r\nA psychology professor (Robin Williams), spends various sessions with Will, and slowly, ever so slowly, Will begins to open up his darker side until both Will and the professor find a bond.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake the premise is original but predictable. However, the acting performances are terrific, especially from Damon, whom I never really had much time for up until this film.\r\n\r\nI was also impressed by the performance of Will's girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver. She soon fell in love with him, only to find that he never reciprocated and pushed her away just as had done to other people who tried to get too close to him in the past.\r\n\r\nIt is very much a feel-good film with a nice satisfying ending. It pulls at the heartstrings sometimes, but you just know everything will work out right in the end."

I have little negatives, yet there isn't much the other way either. I like the cast, but that's honestly about it.\r\n\r\nJames Woods, Danny DeVito and Rip Torn all give noteworthy performances in the roles of Hades, Phil and Zeus. However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.\r\n\r\nBart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments. The animation is actually OK, satisfactory for sure.\r\n\r\nI can see this is very well rated by others, which I respect. For me, though, it isn't any good."

Linz was able to carry this movie, and he did it again in \"Max Keeble's Big Move\".\r\n\r\nI'll be honest I re-watched this because \"Hot Ones\" mentioned Scarlett Johansson was in it, and I couldn't remember that.  She has a bit role, but even back then (possibly unrefined, the role didn't have a lot to work with) she was a big personality in a small role.  She has one, brief, powerful scene that would really be worth remembering: most of it is the messing up the burglars.\r\n\r\nThis has a very different vibe than the first 2 movies.  While Kevin was isolated and unable to get help, Alex starts by doing everything right to get help, but no one believes him so he feels forced to \"do the right thing\".  However it manifests in almost a psychotic fashion.\r\n\r\nOf course, almost everything that happens in this movie should kill someone, but doesn't.  It also had a very easy out: at any time Alex could give the chip up, and it would be over, the bad guys leave the country: he's heavily volunteering for this carnage.  Kevin was being targeted, he saw their faces and was actually defending himself and his home because the \"wet bandits\" were coming for HIM.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's fun and charming, and interesting what the limits of technology were back in 1997 with cellphones and pagers, RC cars with block long range, but not wireless cameras, but remote control gizmos that can turn on the neighbors tv.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with it is that his brother's bird is basically as smart a person, having conversations, and taking bribes (or insisting on being paid at least), and the worst bit is that I know there are people with birds as smart as that.  I'm not sure if it would be a Conure, but I don't deal in parrots.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's not overly hilarious, it's not bad, but it's just not great either."

Not a wise move at the best of times, even more so now as the victim, a hook wielding fisherman, is coming to get them.\r\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much it. Williamson adds some humour into the play, while director Jim Gillespie plays his shock tactics well and keeps the pretty young cast annoying enough for us to want to see the fisherman guy enact revenge.\r\n\r\nIt sadly gets away from itself in the last quarter once the stalker is revealed, and in truth there's very little imagination gone into the whole pic. But it's a decent night in with beer and popcorn for those after a short sharp shock type horror. 6/10"

            "review": "Globetrotting pursuit of a master-of-disguise assassin\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, \"The Jackal\u201d is an international crime thriller about a joint FBI/MVD mission (led by Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora) that enlists the aid of an imprisoned IRA combatant (Richard Gere) to stop a brutal master-of-disguise assassin known as The Jackal (Bruce Willis) from completing a big hit in Washington DC. This was a loose remake of the film \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d (1973), which was based on the 1971 novel by Frederick Forsyth.\r\n\r\nThe first act is too convoluted for my tastes as the story globetrots from Moscow to Helsinki to Canada to the USA. But the movie finds its footing and settles into an entertaining political action flick not far removed from the tone of \u201cThe Saint\u201d with Val Kilmer, released the same year. Both films are from the same genre, have the same tone, were made for the same amount ($60 million), feature an antagonist who\u2019s a master-of-disguise and are named after that person. While both movies made roughly the same in North America ($55-60 million), \u201cThe Jackal\u201d proved more popular worldwide, making almost $160 million, which was $50 million more than \u201cThe Saint.\u201d IMHO \u201cThe Jackal\u201d is the more all-around entertaining picture.\r\n\r\nCritics love to lambaste this movie because (1.) it deviates too much from the original film and (2.) because of the mounting nonsensical elements. But (1.) \u201cThe Jackal\u201d was made to stand on its own in late 90\u2019s cinema and (2.) why do other action thrillers like James Bond get a pass when it comes to ridiculous plot holes? Besides, many of the supposed nonsensical moments can easily be cleared up if you pay attention to the details; not all of them, of course, but many of them.\r\n\r\nWhat I don\u2019t like is the disingenuousness of many of the criticisms. For instance, Roger Ebert\u2019s opening criticism of the film was to mock the way The Jackal sneaks into the USA from Canada by purchasing a sailboat and entering a race from Mackinaw to Chicago. Ebert reasoned that there are easier ways to enter the US inconspicuously along the 3000-mile border, but he left out an important detail: The Jackal was smuggling a huge computerized machine gun and its formidable mount. THAT is why he bought the yacht and used the race as a means to enter the country unnoticeably amidst a crowd of other crafts. Aduh.\r\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of this flick is the great cast and seeing them work together. Poitier was 69 during filming and looks very distinguished; this was incidentally his last theatrical release (although he appeared in four TV movies in the ensuing four years). Jack Black is effective in a peripheral role tailor-made for him.\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s Gere and Willis who steal the show, naturally. The latter is particularly entertaining in an almost shocking departure from his typical easy-going, friendly persona. As The Jackal, Willis is relaxed, carefree, cold, malicious, cunning, calculating, smart, icy and ruthless; a charming psychopath.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't close without mentioning the excellent score by Carter Burwell mixed with an edgy alternative rock soundtrack, featuring cuts by Massive Attack (\"Superpredators\" and \"Dissolved Girl\") and the like.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour, 4 minutes and was shot in Moscow, Finland, Montreal, London, the Carolinas, Virginia and Chicago. SCREENPLAY: Chuck Pfarrer.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

            "review": "Quentin Tarantino, a genius who brought us Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs returned with Jackie Brown, a tale of deception in the world of drugs-smuggling business. Heavily inspired by the 1970\u2019s blaxploitation flicks, it tells the story of a stewardess, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who was pinned inside the cash-smuggling business as she\u2019s tormented between two choices, becoming a cash-mule and in the end snitching her own boss or being smart by keeping the money for herself. It\u2019s quite rare to see a film where the leading role is a female. Even though the plot relies quite much on Elmore Leonard\u2019s novel Rum Punch, Tarantino really did great in giving his own personal touch to the existing materials by adding up a fine composition of clever dialogue, dark humor, and even the ultra violence in the forms of gun-battling badasses, drugs, and absolutely very graphic language, making it absolutely a typical Tarantino flick.\r\n\r\nThis film also possessed its own controversies that put Tarantino in the prosecuted seat because of his frequent use of the word \u201cnigger\u201d. This serious accusation was made by Spike Lee who furiously (while busy counting) noted that was used 38 times, excessively, throughout the film and he claimed that it\u2019s an abuse and definitely an insult to black people. Apart from the above accusation, in my opinion, Jackie Brown, with its strong casts  from Pam Grier, Bridget Fonda, Robert Forester, and Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton and Robert De Niro really add up to the greatness of the film.  The way I see it, every cast here is given a complex set of character for us to study. Both De Niro and Keaton, despite their small roles, they remain favorable and memorable."

None of the cast are memorable, the plot is lazy and the pacing is well off. It does attempt heart, though it doesn't hit all that sharply.\r\n\r\nThe performances of Tim Allen (Michael) and Martin Short (Richard) - though not good - at least keep the film away from the depths of awful. I also think Sam Huntington (Mimi) is alright in this. There's also an appearance from Jumba Jookiba himself, David Ogden Stiers.\r\n\r\nAll in all, It's just a very basic and plain live-action production from Disney. The stereotypical 'jokes' don't help its cause, either."

He eventually teams-up with a surgeon who escaped the perpetrator\u2019s lair (Ashley Judd). Cary Elwes and Tony Goldwyn are also on hand. \r\n\r\n\u201cKiss the Girls\u201d (1997) is a detective thriller in the mold of \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d (1991) with some \u201cSe7en\u201d (1995) and a dash of \u201cScream\u201d (1996), but less gruesome and therefore presumably more palatable to a larger audience. What I appreciate most about this flick is the lush nighttime sylvan cinematography. The cast is good as well.\r\n\r\nThe first half is great for this genre, but the story gets progressively implausible from there with a muddled midsection. And then there\u2019s the \u2018big reveal\u2019 at the end, which was predictable from the get-go. At the end of the day \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d is worthwhile if you like detective thrillers and the cast, but be prepared for a wildly unrealistic tale. The sequel, \u201cAlong Came a Spider\u201d (2001), had the same problem where the \u2018big reveal\u2019 is even more eye-rolling.      \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in North Carolina and Southern Cal.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

            "review": "City of Angels? More Like City of Demons! \r\n\r\nCurtis Hanson directs and co-adapts the screenplay with Brian Helgeland from legendary pulp novelist James Ellroy's novel. It stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.\r\n\r\nIt's 1950s Los Angeles and three cops of very different morals and stature are about to be entwined in crime and corruption...\r\n\r\nI admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.\r\n\r\nTremendous film making. Hanson takes Ellroy's labyrinthine story and pumps it with period authenticity and seamless direction, the latter of which sees him garner superlative performances from the cast. This is the side of Los Angeles nobody wants to talk about, it's awash with corpses, hookers, seedy set-ups, violence, drugs, racism and corruption a go-go. And that's just involving the politicians, the press and the coppers! \r\n\r\nRollo Tomasi.\r\n\r\nThe absence of genuine heroes on show still further keeps \"The City of Angels\" covered in dark clouds, where even as the plot twists and turns, as the mysteries unravel and brutality unfurls, the final destination of the principal characters is never clear, thus there's a continuing edge of seat pulse beat within the pic. It's also sexy and dangerous, the dialogue sharper than a serpent's tooth, and while the ending is a little too cosy as opposed to original noir wave conventions, this is pure noir in all but black and white photography.\r\n\r\nIt won only two Academy Awards, Basinger for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and for Hanson and Hegeland for Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Frankly it should have won a dozen or so for it's not just one of the best films of the 1990s, but also one of the best Neo-Noirs ever produced. 10/10"

Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death materializes as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His \"holiday\" is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).\r\n\r\n\"Meet Joe Black\" (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film \"Death Takes a Holiday\" (which I've never seen). It has the confidence to take its time at almost 3 hours, but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good \"fish out of water\" stories like Spock in Star Trek, \u201cStarman\u201d (1984), etc. \r\n\r\nYes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter touches. I would compare it to \"The Green Mile\" (1999), another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.\r\n\r\nDespite its fantastical premise, \"Meet Joe Black\" consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience \u2014 love, life, death and numerous others, e.g. betrayal, rivalry, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond. One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) offers a definition of love to Joe Black: To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay, presuming they\u2019re penitent. This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.\r\n\r\n\"Meet Joe Black\" cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately it has gone on to garner an enthusiastic following and rightly so 'cause this is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking and genuinely moving. I consider myself a masculine man, but tears flowed through approximately 1/3 of the runtime. This is a sign of a potent and affecting picture.\r\n\r\nIt's a travesty that dreck like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like \"American Beauty\" are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like \"Joe Black\" are often overlooked. The good thing is that time was on Joe Black's side. The word got out.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 58 minutes, and was shot in Warwick, Rhode Island (Aldrich Mansion); Manhattan; and Teaneck, New Jersey. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A/A-"

I agree it's not good, but damn that's low.\r\n\r\nLeslie Nielsen is definitely the best part of the film, he plays the titular character very well. Jennifer Garner is also involved, but the support cast are all rather slack. The premise isn't, at least in my opinion, the worst I've ever seen but it's certainly pretty lacklustre and messy.\r\n\r\nI don't actually think <em>'Mr. Magoo'</em> is <i>that</i> awful though, except for the scene featuring brownface of course. Overall, it's a simple watch - one that doesn't take much attention. Probably worth watching only for Nielsen, and perhaps the dog."

I liked David Brin's tale of the communities growing up from a near-apocalypse and the conman, \"Gordon Krantz.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the (overlong) movie, I was disappointed and felt Responsibility had been tossed aside. However, this tale of a traveling Shakepeare-mangler grew on me. David Brin himself defended the film, saying that the resolution of the battle between the Holnist/Survivalists and the postal carriers was good. \r\n\r\nOur drifter, accompanied by a mule, visits communities and puts on a \"fractured fairy tales\" version of Shakespeare for a meal and a night's lodging. Things go South suddenly, when a Survivalist army surrounds the town and drafts men/boys for the \"Army of the Eight.\" \r\n\r\nThe leader of this gang, prefers that he is the only literate person in the land, and tries to kill \"Shakespeare,\" after turning the traveler's mule into stew. A narrow escape later, the drifter finds a U.S. Postal Service jeep, containing a uniformed skeleton and a bag of mail.\r\n\r\nThus begins his next con job, \"delivering the mail,\" which turns into a Crusade, led by \"Ford Lincoln Mercury,\" his next mail carrier. Romance pops up, when he is asked to father a child for a man who \"caught the bad Measles.\" The Holnists turn up again, and the pair flee the village. \r\n\r\nAfter a long Winter, the drifter and the pregnant woman return to free the village from the Holnists, who have been killing mail carriers. A final showdown with the \"impotent ex-copier salesman\" leads to \"The Restored United States of America\" and a legendary statue of The Postman. 7/10, but the book is 10/10!"

Jon Voight plays the lead lawyer for the insurance company and Roy Scheider the CEO of the corporation.\r\n\r\nBeyond Coppola\u2019s renowned expertise, the cast is stellar, which also includes Mickey Rourke as a smooth legal mogul, Virginia Madsen as a witness and Dean Stockwell & Danny Glover as judges. This was Damon\u2019s break out role as a leading man, paving the way for hits like \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d (1998) and \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d (1998). He\u2019s affable as the principled young lawyer and I liked the way the movie discreetly shows his new home life with the elderly lady, plus other budding relationships.\r\n\r\nThis is decidedly a drama with many courtroom scenes, so don\u2019t except the thrills of other Grisham-based films, like the excellent \u201cThe Firm\u201d (1993) and action-packed \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d (1993), although there is an intense action sequence in the second half. While the first half confidently take its time with the drama, throwing in moments of realistic amusement, it segues into a compelling third act. Furthermore, \u201cThe Rainmaker\u201d is a must for anyone interested in the good, the bad and the ugly of the legal arena in America.\r\n\r\nThe movie made $46 million domestically from a budget of $40 million (not including revenue from other countries), but it was still considered a disappoint in comparison to \u201cThe Firm,\u201d which cost roughly the same amount and made six times as much at the box office. Coppola subsequently took a decade break from directing before reentering the fray with the inscrutable \u201cYouth Without Youth\u201d (2007).\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes and was shot in the Memphis area of Tennessee, as well as Cleveland, Ohio and California (Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

            "review": "Pot's a misdemeanour. Decapitation seems a bit severe.\r\n\r\nThe Relic is directed by Peter Hyams (also cinematographer) and based on the best-selling novel written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. The film stars Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, James Whitmore and Linda Hunt. The music score is composed by John Debney. \r\n\r\nThe Museum of Natural History in Chicago takes delivery of some crates from South America. Sent by an employee, John Whitney, one of the crates appears to be just full of leaves. However, just as the museum prepares to launch a major exhibition, where all the city's top brass will be present, a security guard is horrifically killed. Can superstitious cop Lt. Vincent D'Agosta (Sizemore) and evolutionary biologist Dr. Margo Green (Miller) get to the bottom of the mystery before it's too late?\r\n\r\nFrom the bunch of creature feature movies that surfaced in the 1990s, The Relic may not win prizes for originality of plotting, but it scores high for tension and gloopy fun. Though the decent budget is evident ($70,000,000), the film has all the old fashioned values to make a creature feature work. Rank and file staples come thick and fast; boo jump moments, characters refusing to accept the un-normal, silly kids, silly coppers, a potential hero and heroine, possible romance, some sci-fi babble, a curse, and of course the creature itself - a big hybrid of god knows what! with the \"Kothoga\" being a snarling, slimy monstrosity that goes about the museum lopping heads off some inept human beings with carefree abandon. What's not to like there?\r\n\r\nThough Hyams is no genius director, he is, as his CV suggests, more than capable at crafting a polished movie. Such is the case here, where the \"B\" movie story is given good technical treatment. The lighting (you may have to adjust your settings here) and editing serve the atmosphere well, while the sound work is of the required horror requisitional standard. More importantly, though, Hyams is aware of building up the tension by not unleashing the creature far too soon. We know it's the killer, and we get little snippets of it here and there, but it's not until all hell breaks loose at the big museum event that we get to see the monster, and it's not a let down. Part animatronic/part computer effect, the \"Kothoga\" is original and it is scarily great fun. So much so it (thankfully) steers the viewers away from the pedestrian performances of the cast. Not bad exactly, but just doing grizzled and spunky beauty (Sizemore & Miller respectively) doesn't really grab the attention. The best actor on show is Whitmore (tracing a lovely creature feature line from Them! in 1954 to here), but he is badly under written and under used.\r\n\r\nStill, the minor acting issues matters not, for this is ready made for a Saturday night in with the beer and some snacks, so give it a go and you may just enjoy yourself. 7/10"

It has very little resemblance to the Simon Templar that we got to know in the TV-series starring Roger Moore in the lead role. I have not read the books so I do not know how well the movie actually relates to the books but I have to say that I was a little disappointed to see a Simon Templar that was not really\u2026him.\r\n\r\nI have never really been a huge fan of Val Kilmer and I do not really think he is the best match for the role. But then, as I wrote, I really do not see this as a Simon Templar movie anyway so. Elisabeth Shue is totally unbelievable as a scientist. I know they had to pick someone reasonably good-looking to satisfy the script but still, she just doesn\u2019t cut it as a scientist. The Russians are giving a much better performance. I quite liked both the Tretiak characters.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that this is a bad movie though. You just have to forget about the references to The Saint and Simon Templar. The latter is not very difficult since he really do not call himself Simon Templar in most of the movie anyway. What this movie is though is a fairly decent light entertainment about a skilled high stakes thief with a troubled childhood. I say light entertainment because the plot is really not much more than you would expect from a TV-series pilot. There are some fun action, some fun infiltration, disguises, a bit of high-tech etc. Just a mixture of some \u201cfun stuff\u201d making you go \u201cokay that was not too bad\u201d at the end of the movie.\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing, I know that Simon Templar used to drive a Volvo P1800 but quite frankly, that was the only cool car that Volvo have ever made. Since the movie was so far from what I consider to be Simon Templar it is a real bummer that they had to choose that modern Volvo crap for him to drive."

The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.\r\n\r\nSidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...\r\n\r\nThe film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.\r\n\r\nThis is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.\r\n\r\nScream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10"

            "review": "Do you ever feel evil?\r\n\r\nA Simple Plan is directed by Sam Raimi and adapted to screenplay by Scott Smith from his own novel of the same name. It stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe, Chelcie Ross and Jack Walsh. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Alar Kivilo.\r\n\r\nThe snowy wilds of Midwest America, and two brothers and one friend unearth a crashed plane in the snow that hosts one dead pilot and a duffel bag with over $4 million dollars stashed inside. It's moral quandary time. Keep the money as it's probably drug money anyway, tell the police, or sit on it and wait to see what happens? A decision is made, and it literally turns everyone's life upside down...\r\n\r\nScott B. Smith's novel was perfect for a filmic adaptation, in essence it's classic noir with its small town Americanna setting that houses a moral twist of fate that ultimately sees the town implode from within. How refreshing to find the author adapting his own source material, and not only that, to find that it has also gotten a grade \"A\" production from Raimi and his team.\r\n\r\nThe story is in all truth simple, it asks the characters, and us, what to do when finding so much cash? Fate meant they found it and fate then dealt its moral card, from the point the decision is made, nothing will ever be the same. The tale spins the three male characters, and one pregnant wife, into a vortex of bad decision making and misery. Enter paranoia, greed, murder, panic and a whole host of other bad things to upset the equilibrium that once dominated their mundane, but safe, lives. \r\n\r\nDirector Raimi, who apparently received coaching from his pals Joel and Ethan Coen about how best to work in the snow (the Fargo likeness is well noted by critics), ensures the coldness of the landscape dovetails perfectly with the untangling world of the protagonists. With the frost bitten locale acting as the extra character, and as an accomplice as it happens, Raimi slots in memorable imagery to tickle away at the senses. Animals figure most darkly, with crows and a fox in the hen house beautifully endorsing the themes of decay and the need to kill to survive. While the pacing is sublime, Raimi using a slow dripping tap method that tightens the screws until violence jolts the story, and us, to the precipice.\r\n\r\nAs a character piece it's superbly mounted, where Raimi is indebted to a four pronged delivery of acting performances of some substance. Thornton was rightly lauded for his turn as the slower brother to Paxton's (excellent) all American nice guy, but Briscoe as the \"town drunk\" best friend and Fonda as the inverted femme fatale wife, also deserve great praise for realisation of characters that bring this Shakespearean neo-noir to vivid life. \r\n\r\nElswhere the tech credits are thematically notable. Kivilo's photography is in sync with Raimi's ideals about the snowy backdrop playing a key part, and Elfman's score, while not something to interest potential newcomers to his work, works very well as blunderbuss percussion is replaced by appropriate woodwind that flits about the wooded surrounds with foreboding glee.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day it comes down to quality of story telling, in that regard A Simple Plan is a first class production. If you haven't seen the film or read the novel, then I certainly would recommend the novel to read first as there are inevitable tone downs in the movie. But that is not detrimental to the film's worth, for the visual version of Smith's novel is engrossing, chilling and poignantly bleak. And away from his Indies, it's still Raimi's most accomplished film so far, and he really should consider doing more neo-noir in the future. 9/10"

            "review": "Beautiful Romance - Tragedy Unbound.\r\n\r\nIt has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10"

I always sorta figured, that when I grew up and rewatched it, I'd reach the same conclusion, so, uh, nope. Basically. That never happened. _Toy Story 2_ is pretty good, but nothing on the original.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

We often live our lives without giving a second thought to the simplicity and meaninglessness of life itself. Our limited perspectives keep us from seeing. The lies we are told keep us from the truth. If we could push the boundaries of our reality, what are the odds that we'd face what Truman faced in the end?\r\n\r\nIt was a joy to watch **\"Jim Carrey\"** as **\"Truman\"**, it is yet another proof that Jim isn't just a comedian."

A young Joaquin Phoenix plays TNT a spurned lover that is unforgettable. Billy Bob Thornton  plays a hill billy mechanic from Superior, Arizona and he alone makes the movie worth it. Penn is back to a bitchy character that he so often portrays to a tee. Good flick."

It stars Jamie Lee Curtis, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, Joanna Pacula, Marshall Bell, Sherman Augustus, Cliff Curtis and Julio Oscar Mechoso. Music is by Joel McNeely and cinematography by David Eggby.\r\n\r\nThe crew of an American tugboat boards an abandoned Russian research vessel and quickly sets about claiming salvage rights. However, there is something on board, just not human, and it potentially spells doom for all.\r\n\r\nVirus is a derivative big-budget genre film that is not only a hack job, but almost certainly the lowest point of Donald Sutherland's otherwise superb career. The premise here has been mined many a time before, including the previous year to \"Virus\" with \"Deep Rising\". However, unlike \"Deep Rising's\" glorious sense of fun amongst the creature feature carnage, \"Virus\" is unintentionally funny since it's all played very straight.\r\n\r\nThe humans are up against alien robot thingies, one of which looks suspiciously like a robotic \"Brundlefly\" mixed with \"Short Circuit's Number 5\". There's a modicum of interest in the virus narrative thread, with the need for human body parts a tantalising proposition, but it looks and comes off as feeble steals from better genre pictures. The high energy finale, with whizz bangs and fire crackers, is at least played with good action intent, but by then it's too late to save a rip-off stinker that wastes a very good cast list. 3/10"

Enter Harry Stamper and his rough and rugged crew of deep core drillers. Can NASA get these men up on the asteroid and do the job? The fate of mankind rests with a bunch of odd balls!\r\n\r\nPerhaps because I have a particular kink for the disaster picture, I find it hard to understand the hate for Armageddon. I am after all a man who gleefully defends The Towering Inferno et al with staunch defiance. Armageddon does exactly what was expected from it, ridiculous high octane entertainment with laughs, peril and obligatory chest thumping bravado. All of course cloaked in director Michael Bay's gleeful insistence on blowing things up with devilish panache. Sure there are some twee moments, sure there is some less than great acting on show, but you know what? It's a disaster picture for Michael Bay's crying out loud sake! Check the brain at the door, turn the sound and colour systems up, enjoy the effects on offer and singalong to Aeromith's smashing, \"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\".\r\n\r\nArmageddon, does exactly what it says on the cover, don't take it so serious folks. 8/10"

Instead I guess I'll write 400 some words about it...\r\n:P\r\n\r\nHit man Marky Mark \"just wants people to like him!\" and get's over his head in debt trying to maintain both his mistress' and fiance's lifestyles, all while both treat him like garbage. To get out of debt he joins his \"Funky Bunch\" of buddies to ransom the, unknown to them, connected daughter of a, also unknown to them, bankrupt movie mogul. So not only is hit man Marky Mark a door mat, everyone involved in the caper is a dumb-ass. Couple this with the movie going overboard trying to portray these dumb-asses as \"cool\" and \"edgy\" in the most horribly cringy (and at times super offensive) ways: this was terrible.\r\n\r\nBut it's executive produced by John Woo so the action scenes are great, right? No. The gun fights usually involved Wahlberg doing breakdance moves (remember, he's \"COOOOOL!\") while excessive wire work gets applied to anybody shot. This sounds like it could be cool, and there were some hilariously exaggerated shots (pun intended), but the editing of the action scenes was just really poorly done. \r\n\r\nThey'd cut from shots of Mark spinning on the floor, shooting everywhere, to one of him flying through the air, possibly in a completely different room. A guy would get shot and fly TOWARDS the shooter or sideways. I swear there were guys that would fly through the air or through glass for no reason... just guys flying through the air I guess. And then there's the car chase... So many shots where a car rammed something, was obviously seriously damaged, only to have the car look completely unscathed a second later. \r\n\r\nAlso, Wahlberg's hair color changes inexplicably and seemingly at random throughout the movie. From a reddish brown to an almost greyish/blondish brown to a dark brown. At first I thought it was the stunt double, but it happens in non-action scenes as well. Maybe it was the product he used for different scenes, maybe it was the lighting, but regardless it was weird. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't lose that final star because we did have fun laughing/cringing at how absurd it all was. Looking up stats, this unbelievably doubled it's budget in revenue (seriously, W.T.F.!). It was also fun remembering how awful late 90s styles were, and oh god are some great styles on display here. There's really no need to see this movie though, it really is terrible. If you want to laugh AT a movie, there are so many better ones to choose from."

Quite often the innocence is starkly protested, claims of being duped or threatened into being drug mules through customs borders. Brokedown Palace is an interpretation of one such instance.\r\n\r\nThere's a viable complaint about the film that it condenses the harsh realities of the surroundings, this \"Brokedown Palace\" is not portrayed as the dirty hell holes they so often are in reality. This initially gives the film a sort of false feel, that we are being fed a watered down Hollywood production of something very serious.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking deeper into the picture as a character piece, Jonathan Kaplan's film beats a mighty heart and has brain staying power as well. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale (both superb) are the two friends at the centre of this mystery. Story is more concerned with how their friendship copes under the trying circumstances. Through the initial shock of their situation, to the faux trial, the interactions with others and the relationship they have with their American lawyer, Hank the Yank (Bill Pullman). There's also the not small matter that one of the girls might actually be guilty as charged? Which really gives the piece an intriguing kick.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it falls down in other areas. How come the girls are perfectly coiffured? Quite often splendidly attired in cosmetics? As Kaplan strains for authenticity in human interactions, he loses credibility elsewhere because these two girls look like actors who have had a \"don't make me look ugly\" clause inserted into their contracts. Ultimately when the story is dialled into the two girls and their friendship, Brokedown Palace hits the heights required, elsewhere it's a disappointment and it's not hard to understand why the two lead actresses practically disowned the film shortly after their publicity commitments were over. 6/10"

They play their ridiculous roles well, their characters are - simply - cringey surf 'dudes' - they come across as intended, while Walker and Van Wormer work together nicely under those conditions.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I am not saying this is anything close to a great film. However, it's a pure turn off your brain and watch type of production. It didn't even make me laugh all that much, but the stuff with PW and SVW is enjoyable for some reason. I name those two only, as the other characters and subplot is indeed absolutely terrible.\r\n\r\nI like Dennis Hopper, as most do I'm sure, but his character and story is terrible. It's just as nonsensical as the above, but way less enjoyable. That almost knocked my feelings to give it a bad rating, but thankfully they focus more on Walker/Van Wormer's side of the story; every time Hopper's part appears, it's more of an annoyance than anything else.\r\n\r\nI didn't expect to like this, especially with the cover and how dodgy Disney's barrage of comedies have been so far in the late 1990s. While this isn't anything amazing, it just narrowly gets a 7* rating from me. I do understand why most dislike it."

Based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling novel (an Oprah book club selection), the movie effectively presents the troubling dynamics that exist between family members who've suffered such an unsettling loss.",

The exact same rhetoric is used in this film (\"if you have nothing to hide...\"). At times, it looks like the real world emulates fiction or worse, this film was a blue print.\r\n\r\nFrom a protagonist unaware or unwilling to see the state of affairs, who's unwittingly caught in the path of bad guys, to what might then have been a tinfoil hat wearing, paranoid conspiracy theorist, but would now (post Snowden) be a a very concerned citizen, this film has what it needs to tell a good story.\r\n\r\nWhat's great too is the ending, which is bittersweet. It reflects pretty well what goes on in the highest spheres where the working class has little to no influence.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a great film for everybody."

All set off on a space mission that sees them engulfed by a mysterious storm that imbues them all with different special powers.\r\n\r\nFantastic Four is arguably the most loved on the page of the super-group comic book creations. Certainly it's Marvel's flagship offering in that corner of the super hero market. Odd then, that when it finally makes it to the big screen they throw money at it but employ the director of \"The Firing Squad\" & \"Taxi\"? The whole film reeks of nervousness, with director Tim Story either fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie, or worse still, being directed himself by studio executives fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie. While the casting of Gruffud (dull), Alba (cleavage for hire) and McMahon (out of his depth as a villain) beggars belief. Sloppy CGI fails to ignite what little action there is, while the final smack down as our intrepid 4 battle with Von Doom, is of a TV movie standard. Yet it still has a smidgen of fun about it to warrant investing a damp dark afternoon with.\r\n\r\nChiklis and Evans are the plus points, the former injecting a bit of heart into proceedings and the latter some sexiness and some much needed humour. There's also some worth in the script's attempt at messaging about the perils and pitfalls of celebrity status. While who can deny that the first appearance of \"flame-on\" & \"clobbertime\" doesn't induce an ickle tingle down the spine of the discerning comic book fan (ok that may just be me hankering for my youth). If only the film wasn't so safe and had been in better hands. But hey! the film turned over a $230 million Worldwide profit, so what do I know eh? The sequel was inevitable, so one can only hope that with the same people involved they not only learn from their guardedness, but that they manage to stay faithful to the source and give it some much needed pizazz.\r\n\r\nFootnote: The extended cut at twenty minutes longer, suffice to say, is a better experience as it has more pizazz. So 5/10 for the theatrical cut and 6/10 for the extended version."

This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.\r\n\r\nI found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit \u201csplattery\u201d but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable."

Honestly, if Hollywood had just made this into a generic monster movie, kind of the way they did with Cloverfield, it would have easily been an above average movie, possibly even breaking into 4 star territory. The acting is above average (including the must-have flavor of the month, Jean Reno), the F/X are excellent for 1998 and the plot actually makes sense.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the failure for this movie is that it was made by people not familiar with the franchise and/or what Godzilla means to his fanbase. Godzilla is to the people of Japan what Batman and Superman are to Americans, what Dr. Who and James Bond are to the British and what Shaft and the Black Panther are to the Black Community.\r\n\r\nThe demotion of Godzilla to that of nothing more than an over-sized animal working wholly upon instinct instead of the more humanistic level of intelligence that we in the fandom have come to know and expect was a slap in the face. Furthermore, the final scene where Godzilla is killed (a blasphemy only seen two other times in his 60 year history (Gojira (1954) and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995), the later being the planned end to the franchise in its entirety) by only three F/18s and a total of 6 missiles when entire armies have done nothing more than irritate the King of Monsters was beyond belief. For those not familiar with Godzilla's accomplishments and reputation, imagine the outrage that would come from the respective communities if James Bond was taken out by a mall cop or Superman was killed by 3 six-year-old brats with baseball bats. Now you understand why Japanese movie-goers were storming the box-offices DEMANDING a full refund for this insult and why Toho quickly resurrected their dearly departed Kaiju less than one year later for probably one of the best movies in the entire franchise, Godzilla 1999 (Godzilla 2000 here in the United States).\r\n\r\nAll in all, as a monster movie, Godzilla gets 3.75 stars. However, for a Godzilla movie, it gets a 1 star rating. I'll cut the difference and meet them somewhere around the middle with a 2.5 star final score."

Laurie faked her death and is now a divorced mom with a teenage son. Michael is on his way to finish the job he couldn't finish two decades ago.\r\n\r\nA true and honest Halloween/Michael Myers film this one, there's the distinct feeling that the people behind the series wanted to show that they remember what made the series popular in the first place. It's still the stalk and slash formula of course, but Jamie Lee Curtis returns and her character is nicely written. She's obviously still haunted by events passed and needs a stiff few drinks from time to time to keep the edge off. Yet she's in charge of a private school and is a stern but adoring mother to her son (Josh Hartnett). And she has a boyfriend (Adam Arkin) who cares for her.\r\n\r\nThe first half of film sets up Laurie's new world, while we jump back and forth observing Michael on his journey to final destination. Once the second half revs up, it's the scare time as Laurie's son and his friends come under great peril, which we know will lead to a final confrontation with Laurie. The kills strike hard, the suspense is ramped up, and then it's a frenetic action based finale capped off by a coup de grace of some distinction. All in all it's just a very good and proper Halloween/Myers movie. It didn't reinvent anything, it just turned the wheel full circle and arrived at a fitting closure. 7/10"

He becomes a curious sensation on the network.\r\n\r\n\u201cHoly Man\u201d (1998) combines elements of \u201cMichael\u201d (1996) and \u201cCity of Angels\u201d (1998) to forge its own hybrid and is the obvious precursor to \u201cBruce Almighty\u201d (2003). It failed at the box office mainly because people thought it was going to be a typical Eddie Murphy vehicle, but it\u2019s not. Sure, there\u2019s some comedy, but it\u2019s decidedly low-key with maybe 2-3 laugh-out-loud parts. It\u2019s more of an amusing drama crossed with spiritual docudrama and the unique tone turned people off.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s the least of those three other films, it possesses its own appeal once you catch a grip. The movie seems overlong though and needed tightened up with a rewrite. Still, it has its points of interest. Murphy, for instance, is thoroughly convincing in the title role and his character is certainly intriguing (I think it\u2019s obvious who he really is), not to mention the flick conveys several valuable insights.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in Miami, Florida.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

It stars Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Robert Downey Jr.and Paul Guilfoyle. Music is by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nIn this contrived thriller, Bening is a grief stricken housewife who finds her thoughts in sync with a serial killer (a ridiculously miscast Downey Jr.). Neil Jordan is a great director, but he's also a very frustrating one, case in point In Dreams. The visuals are outstanding here as Jordan and Khondji paint a nightmarish world, but the flashbacks are unfocused and any sense of suspense or plot progression is lost in a whirl of stylised indulgence. Strip away the style and you find a formulaic serial killer picture hiding behind arty farty stubbornness. Bening's performance deserves a better movie, and it is with her, and the visual smarts, that the pic remains of interest till its resolution. 5/10"

            "review": "Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson\u2019s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, \u201cTo the bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm!\u201d are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments \u2014 notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil \u2014 when Jackson\u2019s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes \u2014 \u201cWhat no Tom Bombadil?\u201d \u2014 Jackson\u2019s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves\u2019 surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien\u2019s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothl\u00f3rien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can\u2019t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light \u2014 total darkness \u2014 but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine"

Mat LeBlanc actually surprises me by showing he has some action range,  a young Lacey Chabert comes off much more obnoxious than I  would have expected, and solid, if expected, performances from William Hurt, Heather Graham, and Gary Oldman.\r\n\r\nThere is just very little that goes beyond expectations.  Don't get me wrong there are some very interesting sequences and effects, but just nothing impressive I'm going to remember down the line.\r\n\r\nIn the end I had a good time, and I'd do it again, but I'd rather see a more modern or higher production version of this like \"Voyager\"."

            "review": "High definition a necessity for this delightful homage to swashbucklers.\r\n\r\nZorro senior tutors Zorro junior in the way of the blade, their combined goal? To enact revenge on Don Rafael Montero and Capt. Harrison Love respectively.\r\n\r\nMartin Campbell was an interesting and wise choice for this latest take on the swashbuckling heroics of the Latin Robin Hood. Campbell was the man in the director's chair for both of James Bond's reinvigoration's, firstly with \"Golden Eye\" in 1995, and then with \"Casino Royale\" in 2006. For here it's evident that The Mask Of Zorro has no delusions of grandeur in the pantheon of cinema, it wants (and is) to be an action film with pure fantastical flamboyance pouring from practically every frame. It honours the swashers of old by ensuring all genre boxes are ticked, yep, we got swords a plenty, yep, we got a dashing hero (x 2 actually), yep, we got a spiffing looking villain, and yes we got a heaving bosom led romance into the mix as well. While Campbell and his team of screenwriters gleefully ensure that humour is a very prominent thing, thus keeping the fantasy in the comic book realm from which Zorro's essence comes.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work on show is top draw, none more so than during a horse chase sequence where this Zorro tips its hat to former glorious genre pieces (well done Tony Angelotti). Other notable technical aspects deserve a mention, the costumes from Graciela Maz\u00f3n are desirable and now in this age of High Definition Cinema, good make up work really comes to the fore, so it be that that department did sterling work on this picture (check out Elena's gorgeous face). The cast are basically very strong, Antonio Banderas slips into the Zorro cape with charming ease, and though it's nice to see a Spanish actor playing the famous Spanish character, here in this adaptation the irony is that Zorro is Mexican! Anthony Hopkins is as elegant as ever as the elder, newly retired Zorro AKA: Don Diego de la Vega, and Catherine Zeta Jones is positively ravishing as Elena, while Stuart Wilson does a nice line in pompous villainy as Don Rafael Montero.\r\n\r\nSome minor complaints do dwell within the picture. Campbell has a lot to fit into a running time of two hours and twenty odd minutes, and this makes the wait for the rip roaring finale longer than one at first wished for. Though for sure let it be noted that the gold mine action bonanza at pics end is totally worth the wait. Weak in the cast is Matt Letscher as Captain Love, oddly looking like some Kiefer Sutherland tribute act, he lacks any real menace for what is a pretty well written role. James Horner's score lacks the necessary boom boom bang bang that someone like Alfred Newman would have provided, and a comedy horse strand pushes the boundaries of acceptable genre homages a little too far.\r\n\r\nBut really why moan and groan at irks that don't alter the trajectory of The Mask Of Zorro's blade? It isn't trying to do anything other than whisk you along for a blade swashing ride, and that is something that it most assuredly succeeds in doing. 8/10"

The movie starts of reasonably well being somewhat intelligent with a bit of Mission Impossible feel to it. It is actually almost a bit slow at times. However, for the second half of the movie it really degrades into a classical John Woo, over the top, action feast with all pretense of intelligence and any true Mission Impossible feel gone. John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie.\r\n\r\nAs with the first movie if it would not have been labelled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it a higher rating since it is a decent enough, mostly braindead though, Hollywood action movie. However, I have higher expectations from a movie labelled Mission Impossible.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is quite okay as Ethan Hunt. Dougray Scott is okayish as the bad guy. Sometimes he projects the right big bad and mad bad-guy attitude but sometimes he is just silly and just as over the top as the action scenes. He is supposed to be a mastermind but he comes out as a thug a\u2019 la a not so intelligent drug baron in many scenes.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes? Well, they are classical John Woo material. Fast paced with a lot of stunts and things that go boom. They are also, as expected, hugely over the top and unbelievable. They provide a enjoyable visual experience but, as I wrote above, they are not really what I would expect from a Mission Impossible movie.\r\n\r\nThe romance between Hunt and Nyah is the typical Hollywood, let\u2019s throw in a sexy girl and some superficial attraction, which develops from get lost to I love you in the matter of a few hours of contact, between the lead character and the girl. Meh!\r\n\r\nI get the impression that the people that have created these movies so far have not really watched a single full season of Mission Impossible."

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the <em>'Shrek'</em> franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.\r\n\r\nI do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable."

None of the humour got laughs, or mild amusement, out from me - except one scene involving a toilet, which is marginally amusing. It also tries to join the comedy up with heart, especially between Martin and Tim, but it simply doesn't hit. There are moments where I could tell the film wanted me to care for the character(s) but I never did.\r\n\r\nIt's also a surprisingly horny film, with iffy innuendo and even some inappropriate touching in there. If this was an <em>'American Pie'</em> type of film then it might fit, but it feels very out of place here. Zoot (Wayne Knight) confirms those words, his dumb character is obnoxious.\r\n\r\nKnight, who is oddly uncredited, is joined by Christopher Lloyd (Martin) and Jeff Daniels (Tim). That should be a great match, but they never really click together in my opinion - a missed opportunity, for sure. Elizabeth Hurley (Brace) and Daryl Hannah (Lizzie) are also involved, though the female characters are pretty pointless - Hurley has a small part in the main plot at one point, at least.\r\n\r\nIt's a no from me. Straight into the bottom ten of Disney live-action, of the ones I've seen up until '99. Perhaps fans of the original television series will enjoy this, but I didn't."

But, while this movie is definitely far from even being very good, it is still a fairly decent movie, and while it is so short, it actually manages to have some very funny scenes with Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan that are also definitely reminiscent of some of the SNL skits funniest moments. But, despite the PG-13 Rating, this movie is not appropriate for young kids or even most teen's: There is frequent crude and sexual humor with three very graphic but somewhat comical sex scenes that actually fairly much push the limit for the PG-13 rating. Also, there is some infrequent profanity with at least one useof the F-word. Finally, there is a extremely brief and subtle drug reference near the beginning of the movie that only older audiences watching the movie will get. So, it may not be a great comedy, or even a terribly memorable one, but it still makes you laugh while it's going."

            "review": "Possibly one of the funniest satirical stabs at sexuality, AIDS and LGBT relationships. Don Roos known for television direction and script writing tries his hand at a theatrical film. The movie stars Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Ivan Sergei. Sixteen year old Dede Truitt (Ricci) is the opposite of sweet sixteen, politically incorrect and acid-tongued. When her stepfather passes away she runs away from home, and pays her half brother Bill (who is a gay teacher) a visit. Unaware that he has an alternative lifestyle, she meets his significant other, Matt (Sergei).\r\n\r\nDede takes a liking to Matt and seduces him into having sex with her, much to the dismay of Bill (Donovan) and Lucia Dalury (Kudrow), who is the sister of Bill's former boyfriend Tom who passed away. Dede then tells them she is pregnant and Matt is the father, the two elope and run away with Bill's safety deposit money and Tom's ashes. The chase begins, to add more tension Bill has to deal with Matt's other boyfriend. The grunge looking flamboyant Jason Bock (Johnny Galecki), who slanders Bill by falsely accusing him of molestation.\r\n\r\nBill at risk of losing his job, must track down Dede and Matt in order to clear his name. Meanwhile, Lucia who is a repressed old maid is disgusted by the thought of sex. With the help of a Carl Tippet (Lyle Lovett) they track down Dede and Matt only to discover that she has hooked up with Randy, a somewhat religious old friend of hers whose beliefs clash with Matt. The two then make a run for it, leaving Bill, Matt and Lucia concerned about Dede's well-being. Meanwhile, Bill is hounded by the media and tabloids thanks to Jason's false accusation much to the frustration of Lucia.\r\n\r\nWith the help of law enforcement they are able to track down Dede and Randy at a motel. Dede angry that Randy is wasting her money coldly breaks up with him, causing him to be physically abusive. They get into an altercation which ends with Dede and Randy fighting on the bed and her firearm going off. Matt then arrives to the motel and after Dede tells him she accidentally killed Randy they flee. With no other choice other than to stay at the motel Lucia and Bill check-in. Bill and Lucia then have a falling out after learning that Tom's AIDS was the result of gay sex.\r\n\r\nJust then Carl arrives at Lucia's room, and both find themselves in the heat of the moment. Lucia finally is able to get over her disgust of sexuality, but is unable to leave Bill alone. Bill learns he is suspended without pay, and is later surprised by Jason who has a message for him. Bill frustrated with the events and Jason's false accusation painfully forces him to reveal the location of Dede and Matt. Upon learning that Matt and Dede are in Canada, Bill and Lucia are able to track them down.\r\n\r\nDede frustrated that Jason told Bill where they were located then goes into labor. It is then that Bill, Lucia, Dede, Matt and Jason must all put their differences aside and help Dede in her time of need. Dede gives birth to a healthy baby boy, but then shows signs of postpartum hemorrhaging. The others are relived to learn that Dede and the baby are okay. Dede and Matt are then brought back to answer questions about their actions. Dede ends up doing time in jail for Randy's death, but a lack of evidence and Randy's corrupt religious beliefs play in her favor.\r\n\r\nLucia then discovers she is pregnant and gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Matt and Bill go their separate ways and Bill ends up dating Dede's parole officer. Deciding her baby will be happy with her brother she gives him full custody. Dede then realizes that she never wanted to get involved with sex, because of its consequences (disease, pregnancy and worst of all relationships). The movie ends with Dede stating that she was a changed person after that summer.\r\n\r\nWhile not a financial success, despite being produced on a reasonable budget  and being produced by a studio that was running into financial issues the movie does manage to get a few good laughs out of its audience. Christina Ricci proves her versatility in the transition from kid-friendly films to more adult fare. Her portrayal of the acid-tongued Dede Truitt is wickedly delightful. Lisa Kudrow's Lucia is our opposite to the happy somewhat cheerful Phoebe Buffay, as the acid-tongued spinster who is sexually repressed she sells this role. Martin Donovan, Ivan Sergei and Johnny Galecki are all charming as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like satirical films and can laugh at human sexuality, then I highly recommend this film. Sony Pictures Classics was generous enough to take over this film after Rysher Entertainment gave it up due to financial woes. The company may not have been able to top major studios but it certainly went out with a bang thanks to this film. Alright, I think you've seen enough now go watch the film."

            "review": "Mischief Loves Comedy! \"The Parent Trap\" is a remake of the original 1961 film by Walt Disney Productions. Starring Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Lohan and Elaine Hendrix. The film begins with Nicholas Parker (Quaid) and Elizabeth James (Richardson) meeting on the Queen Elizabeth II. The two fall in love and decide to become husband and wife, and we are treated to a beautifully choreographed wedding ceremony. The movie skips to 11 years later, the couple has divorced and has full custody of each of their daughters, Hallie and Annie. The girls then meet up at a summer camp and engage in a rivalry. However when one pranks goes too far they must share a cabin together.\r\n\r\nThough initially at each other's throats the girls learn to bond and get along. Discovering they share the same birthday and only have one parent and one photograph of their respective parents, the girls discovered that their half-pictures make a complete picture. The girls then realize that they are twins, and devise a plan to reunite their parents. Through coaching and hair trimming Hallie and Annie take each other's places. Hallie goes to London under the guise of Annie James, and is taken home where she meets her mother for the very first time. Annie under the guise of Hallie goes back to Napa and is thrilled to see her father for the first time.\r\n\r\nHallie and Elizabeth bond when she is asked to go to work and help out a client with her wedding attire. Annie and Nick arrive home and Annie is shocked to find that her father is seeing another woman (Hendrix). Chessy (Lisa Ann Walters), Nick's nanny is very distrustful of her and assumes she is a gold digger. Nick formally introduces her as Meredith Blake, and Annie is forced to meet her and tells Meredith that Nick has a system for meeting new women. Annie then decides to call Hallie and alert her that their father is in love, despite her pleas to bring Elizabeth to America Hallie refuses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Chessy is suspicious of Annie who is opposite Hallie: neat as a pin, has a small appetite and notices that Hallie's dog is acting strange around Annie. Annie desperately tries to sabotage Nick and Meredith's unexpected engagement. While Elizabeth, Martin and Grandfather are suspicious of Hallie when her mannerisms are not like Annie's. Desperate, Annie calls Hallie and insists that if they want their parents to remarry they have to bring Elizabeth to America and sabotage the engagement together. Hallie then realizes that it is time to come clean, and tells Elizabeth the truth.\r\n\r\nElizabeth then decides to fly to America, but hesitant and stressed insists that Martin chaperone her. Annie arranges for Elizabeth, Hallie and Martin to meet Nick and Meredith's parents at the Stafford Hotel. The plan works but Elizabeth is furious to learn that the girls are plotting to reunite her with Nick. Unfortunately, Meredith learns that the girls are twins and that Nick and Elizabeth were married. The girls then decide to recreate their parents' first date, but it does not phase either Nick or Elizabeth. One last ditch effort is to convince Elizabeth to go with Nick and Hallie on an annual camping trip.\r\n\r\nElizabeth through means of trickery makes Meredith go in her place. After a series of pranks such as rocks in her sack, a lizard in her hair and pushing her air mattress into the water Meredith snaps. She then insists that Nick make a decision his daughters or his fiancee. Nick realizes that Meredith is a gold digger and a shrew and coldly breaks up with her by choosing Hallie and Annie. Elizabeth shocked to discover Meredith has broken up with Nick, reveals that Martin and Chessy have started a relationship. Nick decides to show Elizabeth his vintage wine collection and tells her that he now owns the rights to the wine they drank at their wedding. Elizabeth tearfully decides to go back to London, as everyone says good-bye Nick and Hallie decide that they can't lose their family again.\r\n\r\nHallie and Nick surprise Annie and Elizabeth when they arrive home. Nick then says he is not willing to lose her again, Elizabeth at first is hesitant to accept his offer but then realizes she has loved him all along. The two then share a passionate kiss and get remarried upon the same ship. The movie ends with photos from the wedding and Martin surprising Chessy by popping the question.\r\n\r\nAs far as remakes go, this one has a lot to offer for both the adults and kids. The humor and hijinks are hilarious and very well-done, similar to \"Home Alone\" and \"Dennis the Menace\". The cast does a good job portraying their characters and there are times you can feel the emotions they are going through. It's a wonderful remake and a very good film from Walt Disney Pictures. Highly Recommended."

            "review": "Indestructible Gibson in grim and gritty telling of The Hunter.\r\n\r\nThis is not an out and out remake of John Boorman's 1967 offering Point Blank, the structure is different from the 67 film, and where Point Blank is a dark psychological thriller that is rightly regarded as being towards the top of the neo-noir tree, this Brian Helgeland directed film really should be seen as a different interpretation of Donald E. Westlake's novel The Hunter.\r\n\r\nMel Gibson plays tough as nails thief Porter, who is double crossed, shot, and then left for dead by his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) and his partner in crime Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). We are then taken on a dark journey as Porter sets out to reclaim the $70.000 that he was shot and almost killed for. He wants no more, no less than what he is owed, and he literally will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Including taking on the Chicago mob organisation known as The Outfit.\r\n\r\nPayback is a mean and violent movie, it is unrelenting in its willingness to keep nastiness at the top of the story. The film is full of flawed and vile people, even Porter himself, the closest we have to a (anti) hero has badness coursing through his veins, he is a dislikable killer, the film is about exactly what the tag-line suggests, Get Ready To Root For The Bad Guy! As Porter trawls through this part of Chicago, he will come across bent coppers, drug pushers/addicts/runners, Asian gangsters, prostitutes, violence fetishists and the slimy chain of command of the Chicago mob. Nobody here is about to cheer you up.\r\n\r\nThe style of the film owes its being to classic film noir and the 1970s hard crime movies led by Dirty Harry and Death Wish. The makers had originally wanted to film it in black and white, but instead went for a de-saturation technique, a bleach by-pass process that really puts a grim grey and blue sheen on the visuals. The thumping score is tonally correct, while a good sound track also helps (always nice to see hear Voodoo Chile), and the use of voice over narration by Porter evokes the classic noir period and works a treat because it's not over done.\r\n\r\nThe film strongly relies on Mel Gibson to bring menace and a measure of sympathy to the vengeful Porter, and it is with much credit that he manages to achieve both these things skilfully. He is backed by a strong support cast, Maria Bello admirable in her big shift from TV to film - Lucy Liu hilarious and stunningly sexy as a dominatrix and Gregg Henry is just wild. The Outfit chain of command features William Devane, James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson, all slick and welcome additions, even if they are all under used; though this is more by narrative necessity than film making decisions. Bill Duke, David Paymer and Jack Conley fill out the impressive roll call of scum-bags.\r\n\r\nViolent, laconic and darkly comic as well, Payback is one of the best remakes around, a neo-noir essential in fact. 8.5/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: Director Helgeland released his own Directors Cut in 2006. Unhappy with the original version, he changed some of the structure and visual style and made it shorter by ten minutes. It's inferior to the 100 minute original cut in my opinion, losing much of the noir stylisations, but the last quarter is different and will (does) certainly appeal to others."

            "review": "You should thank me. Artists are always appreciated more after they're dead! \r\n\r\nA Perfect Murder is directed by Andrew Davis and written by Frederick Knott and Patrick Smith Kelly. It stars Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David Suchet and Sarita Choudhury. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. \r\n\r\nA powerful husband. An unfaithful wife. A jealous lover. All of them have a motive. Each of them has a plan.\r\n\r\nA re-imaging of \"Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder\", which itself was by the great director's admission not one of his best, Andrew Davis' (\"The Fugitive\") film may not reach great heights, but it at least is its own animal. The twists and turns are solid enough for entertainment purpose, and suspense is never far away. The characterisations bring about differing and alternating responses from the viewers, which is a nice trick in the tale, and while the finale seems a touch \"popcorn crowd appeasing\", this rounds out as a satisfying suspense thriller. 7/10\r\n\r\n\r\nExcellent performances, with interesting twists on the original film, and compelling direction by THE FUGITIVE\u2018s Andrew Davis highlight this intriguing suspense film. The film isn\u2019t without it\u2019s flaws, as you may find it difficult to resolve the fact that you\u2019ll probably wind up rooting for the murderous Douglas not only due to his usually being the good guy in his films but because the lovers are severely flawed characters most will think deserving of getting offed, especially the lame-ass Mortensen as Paltrow\u2019s love interest. With PSYCHO and REAR WINDOW also being made this year, I am left with mixed feelings about this latest trend. On the one hand, these remakes speak to the fact of Hitchcock\u2019s timeless themes in his films, while on the other hand it points out that Hollywood has perhaps run out of ideas when even a remake of a middling Hitchcock film is one of the better thrillers to come out in recent years."

It even looks like they lifted a character directly out of \"Alice in Wonderland\", and maybe there was a legal loophole they had , but it was really unnecessary.\r\n\r\nHonestly, most of the premise is a lot of nonsense, and I don't mean to dash dreams and lose the fancy of imaginative creation, but it's not even just fun.  They took one of the few popular free stories (King Arthur) that Disney hadn't monopolized (\"Sword in the Stone\" only covers Arthur as a child, and this is after Camelot was realized), and then added so much magical guff to it that it was hardly recognizable as a version of the original story.  This is not a \"King Arthur and his Knights\" story, it's a Kayley, and you don't know who that is because they made her up.\r\n\r\nEven Cary Elwes (Princess Bride: The Man in Black), by far the best actor /  character in the movie, seems to have impatient disdain for having to perform the role, and he's probably the 3rd most occurring character.\r\n\r\nA knight that Arthur never would have made a knight, that the audience doesn't know, traitors the crown (when Lancelot did it, it was impactful) and kills a knight, that the audience doesn't know or care about, so the main character is launch into adventure on a basis that the audience objectively doesn't care about, and that adventure is further preluded with a Griffon dropping Excaliber into a cursed wood (which would have normally been represented by Merlin and/or the Woad), and having some magic would be fine, but they basically rip off the \"Fire Swamp\" from \"Princess Bride\" and add in all these questionably real people with weapons for hands.\r\n\r\nEverything I just wrote sounds insane, and that's without the guide being blind or there being a 2-headed dragon that hates  itselves.\r\n\r\nI'm tired, and you should skip this unless you just have to see the train wreck."

And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground \"Hive,\" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more. \r\n\r\nPanned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't \"get\" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent \"Beach House\" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the \"Resident Evil\" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure.  Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing \"Event Horizon.\""

            "review": "Great WWII war action in France, but too much of the drama is weak\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, \"Saving Private Ryan\" (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.\r\n\r\nNo one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.\r\n\r\nIn between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I've seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie, e.g. the original \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979).\r\n\r\nMoreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.\r\n\r\nIn light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as \"the greatest war movie ever made.\" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.\r\n\r\nI've heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken \"verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion.\" I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father\u2019s stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it\u2019s resolved (ooh, the Captain\u2019s a high school teacher, whoopee).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can\u2019t beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France.

He receives an urgent call from Admiral Dougherty about Data, that was sent on an observation mission of the Ba'Ku race. The Federation has installed there a hidden outpost and the So'Na race is there too. Data has gone out of control and reveals the federation outpost to the natives. Picard and his senior officers get on the planet to discuss with them to surrender the Federation personnel.\r\n\r\nHe is welcomed by the (extremely) peaceful Ba'Ku that are represented by Anji and Sojef, that explain the history and philosophy of their people. They have settled on this planet generations ago and have benefited from a local radiation extending their life greatly.\r\nPicard is pushed by Dougherty to leave the planet to let the \"observation\" mission without interference. Picard smells deception and will have to disobey orders to defend one of the Federation's basic principles.\r\nI know most people don't like this movie and rank it low among the Star trek movies. Of course there's not much action and fights. The new characters are either very boring or too obviously \"evil\". \r\n\r\nBut the main point here is to defend the \"prime directive\" (= not to interfere in the development of a civilization that is inferior in technology. There is not much else here than a deep analysis of what the Federation is and when it must or not intervene. So there's a light love story wit Picard and Anij, Data befriends a kid in his discovery of humanity's young age behavior.\r\n\r\nAfter many movies about the Klingons, Romulans ... I found it fresh to have two (?) new races with different histories and ways of life. And having the movie centered on the \"prime directive\", and how a cunning race can twist it (after all, the Ba'Ku are not really \"natives\" of the planet and shouldn't be protected by the prime directive), and how one superior officer, if misleaded, can lead to eradication of hundreds of people."

            "review": "Tarzan swings through the iridescent jungle swiftly, ending Disney\u2019s Renaissance era with wild exuberance. Two worlds, one family. An innocent little boy, approximately four-years old, was escorted for the first time to a cinema complex. Politely requesting a bucket of sweet polystyrene popcorn, he walked into the dimly lit auditorium scavenging for an appropriate seat that would maximise his film experience. The trailers initiated, suppressing the inner excitement of the full feature that was yet to commence. Then, it happened. The Disney logo emerged. It was time. A family surviving a shipwreck, colonising an uncharted jungle whilst the emphatic voice of Phil Collins powered the narrative. A leopard savaging a baby gorilla, then brutally slaying the English couple, leaving only their infant son crying. His sorrowful echoes reverberating through the rainforest, until a female gorilla acquires him. Adopting a human child. Tarzan. The four-year old, naive to the cruelty of nature, was transfixed by the colourful animation. The plethora of emotions. That pure Disney magic. It was the commencement of a new-founding love for cinema. An adoration he could never shake off again. Yes, that four-year old, was me.\r\n\r\nSubjectively speaking, Tarzan is more than just another Disney classic from their animated library. Even more than just an adaptation of Burroughs\u2019 epic. It was a trigger. A sweeping adventure that upheld every emotional resonance possible. The brooding romance between explorer Jane and fully-adolescent Tarzan. Thematically presenting ostracism through two interconnected species, conveying the \u201cTwo Worlds, One Family\u201d conflict within Tarzan. Who we are raised to be and who we are truly meant to become. Comedic buoyancy through the supporting characters of Terk and Tantor, supplied with their own catchy rhythms. Dark antagonisms through Clayton\u2019s treacherous hunting techniques, viewing gorillas as merchantable assets. An exploration into the vivacious rainforests of Africa. All culminating to form a wonderfully effervescent coming-of-age tale. One of Disney\u2019s most overlooked, for sure.\r\n\r\nThe art direction is the strongest of the Renaissance period, combining traditional hand-drawn animation with pioneering three-dimensional backgrounds. Often incorporating visual montages to steer the narrative into the intended direction. Watercolour backdrops to enhance the naturalistic environment. Bright character designs to contrast the darkened background. Sublimely directed by Lima and Buck. Then, Phil Collins just being the legendary musician that he is, providing the tale with apathy and soul. The \u201cTwo Worlds\u201d anthem, \u201cYou\u2019ll be in my Heart\u201d and \u201cStrangers Like Me\u201d. Mancina\u2019s score actively preventing the characters from singing and turning into another unnecessary musical. As I said, subjectively I refuse to liken Tarzan to just another animation from the \u201cHouse of Mouse\u201d. It was my first cinema endeavour after all.\r\n\r\nHowever, objectively, there are narrative stumbles. It\u2019s the breeziest story, condensing an epic plot into less than ninety minutes. The most noticeable consequence of this, is the rushed editing on certain segments. The introductory two minutes is a whirlwind of emotional storytelling that, unfortunately, holds minimal foundations. The montages of Tarzan growing up also lacked narrative heft, providing nothing more than visual delights. Goldwyn, Close and O\u2019Donnell had insufficient power within their voice roles. Although Driver and Blessed were delightful. And, as much as I adore the song, the repetitious reprises of \u201cTwo Worlds\u201d throughout minimised lyrical diversity.\r\n\r\nThe entire story is told faster than a shotgun firing, but I refuse to shake my undying adoration for this feature. Tarzan was the film that made me the cinephile that I am today. If I hadn\u2019t received that euphoric pleasure from the cinema back in \u201899, well, these amateur reviews probably would never have been written. Ever. So for that, Tarzan and Disney have my eternal gratitude."

            "review": "The circumstances around Terence Malick's <i>The Thin Red Line</i> are sometimes more talked about than the film itself. The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War&nbsp;II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.\r\n\r\n<i>The Thin Red Line</i> tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sargeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who sees the infantry as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese.\r\n\r\nFor most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.\r\n\r\nWhile the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and its hard to knock any World War&nbsp;II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very \"Hollywood\" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions."

He & his team hunt down an escaped prisoner named Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) from wilderness regions to the streets of New York City. Robert Downey Jr. is on hand as a Defense Security Service agent who assists the marshals.\r\n\r\nThis sequel makes you realize just how well-done \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d is. It features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic. The first act with the plane crash & swamp sequence is decent but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to bus crash/train wreck & dam sequence of the prior flick. Snipes is effective, but his character doesn\u2019t evoke the sympathy of Kimble (Ford) because for most of the movie we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s innocent or not.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if you\u2019re in the mood for a movie cut from the same cloth as \u201cThe Fugitive,\u201d \u201cEnemy of the State\u201d (1998) and \u201cCon Air\u201d (1997) then \u201cU.S. Marshals\u201d should fill the bill, but it\u2019s the least of these. I\u2019d put it on par with \u201cPatriot Games\u201d (1992) and \u201cMoney Train\u201d (1995).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Tennessee (Reelfoot Lake), Kentucky (Benton), Illinois (Chicago, Bay City, West Vienna, Metropolis & Shawneetown) and New York City.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

I have no frame of reference with the source materials, but even though I'm a big Westerns fan, it wasn't this, or the critical pounding it got on release, that kept me away. It was the original trailers for it, it just looked like a garbled over budgeted mess - which it kinda is. \r\n\r\nHowever, that's not to say there isn't fun to be had, because for all its many failings (poor effects, poor script, waste of a strong cast, superficiality), there is some verve and swagger, excitement, Will Smith's likability and some splendid gadgets. Having very low expectations no doubt helped me out, but I would hardly call this a 1/10 type of film. I say chill out with a beer, turn the home cinema speakers up and just roll with it, because thinking about it too deeply could possibly make you angry... 5/10"

The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.\r\n\r\nThe unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and a small percentage of humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant \"X\" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are old friends, take totally contrasting positions: Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a \"Brotherhood of Mutants\" with an attitude of superiority. Unfortunately, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\r\n\r\nYou could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.\r\n\r\nAlthough everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality: \"X-Men\" (2000), \"X2: X-Men United\" (2003) and \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" (2006).\r\n\r\n\"X-Men\" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are introduced and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and nobly opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as adolescents Iceman and Pyro. Both groups of mutants meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which is the weakest part of the film, but not bad.\r\n\r\nWhen \"X-Men\" debuted in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since \"Superman\" (1978) and \"Superman II\" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the quality of many of those films.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes with several interesting deleted scenes available.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

While testing her new virtual reality game out with a focus group, an assassination attempt puts her on the run with an ally of sorts, marketing man Ted Pikul (Jude Law). With the prototype of the new game in their possession, the pair must enter the game's realm to unlock the various puzzles and threats that now confounds and stalks them.\r\n\r\nWith Cronenberg back to writing something solely from his own head, eXistenZ finds the Canadian auteur happy to be back making a truer piece of work for his kinked visions. Unfortunately the advent of such virtual reality fare and various realist themes was well in filmic swing come the time eXistenZ was released, rendering it in some eyes as a band wagon jumper. That's unfair, because it's still a unique film, as Cronenberg blends body horror with visual invention to create a mind warp of gaming possibilities, a thrum thrum of futuristic verve. He gets top performances out of Leigh (great hair as well) and Law, while the narrative is constantly tricky enough to demand the viewer pays attention whilst being prepared to, perhaps, be surprised.\r\n\r\nNot prime Cronenberg, but still smart and funky, twisty and nutty, scary and oblique. So very much a Cronenberg original, then. 8/10"

But this is the fourth movie of the famous series, and we think we know the territory; many of the early reviews have been blase, paying lip service to the visuals and wondering why the characters aren't better developed. How quickly do we grow accustomed to wonders. I am reminded of the Isaac Asimov story \"Nightfall,\" about the planet where the stars were visible only once in a thousand years. So awesome was the sight that it drove men mad. We who can see the stars every night glance up casually at the cosmos and then quickly down again, searching for a Dairy Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,\" to cite its full title, is an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking. If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable: This is the first story in the chronology and has to set up characters who (we already know) will become more interesting with the passage of time. Here we first see Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and R2-D2 and C-3PO. Anakin is only a fresh-faced kid in Episode I; in IV, V and VI, he has become Darth Vader.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of offending devotees of the Force, I will say that the stories of the \"Star Wars\" movies have always been space operas, and that the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. I do not attend with the hope of gaining insights into human behavior. Unlike many movies, these are made to be looked at more than listened to, and George Lucas and his collaborators have filled \"The Phantom Menace\" with wonderful visuals.\r\n\r\nThere are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls, and speakers floating on pods in the center. And other places: the cityscape with the waterfall that has a dizzying descent through space. And the other cities: one city Venetian, with canals, another looking like a hothouse version of imperial Rome, and a third that seems to have grown out of desert sands.\r\n\r\nSet against awesome backdrops, the characters in \"The Phantom Menace\" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained \"Julius Caesar.\" I wish the \"Star Wars\" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.\r\n\r\nThe plot details (of embargoes and blockades) tend to diminish the size of the movie's universe--to shrink it to the scale of a 19th century trade dispute. The stars themselves are little more than pinpoints on a black curtain, and \"Star Wars\" has not drawn inspiration from the color photographs being captured by the Hubble Telescope. The series is essentially human mythology, set in space, but not occupying it. If Stanley Kubrick gave us man humbled by the universe, Lucas gives us the universe domesticated by man. His aliens are really just humans in odd skins. For \"The Phantom Menace,\" he introduces Jar Jar Binks, a fully realized computer-animated alien character whose physical movements seem based on afterthoughts. And Jabba the Hutt (who presides over the Podrace) has always seemed positively Dickensian to me.\r\n\r\nYet within the rules he has established, Lucas tells a good story. The key development in \"Phantom\" is the first meeting between the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd)--who is, the Jedi immediately senses, fated for great things. Qui-Gon meets Anakin in a store where he's seeking replacement parts for his crippled ship. Qui-Gon soon finds himself backing the young slave in a high-speed Podrace--betting his ship itself against the cost of the replacement parts. The race is one of the film's high points, as the entrants zoom between high cliff walls in a refinement of a similar race through metal canyons on a spaceship in \"Star Wars.\" Why is Qui-Gon so confident that Anakin can win? Because he senses an unusual concentration of the Force--and perhaps because, like John the Baptist, he instinctively recognizes the one whose way he is destined to prepare. The film's shakiness on the psychological level is evident, however, in the scene where young Anakin is told he must leave his mother (Pernilla August) and follow this tall Jedi stranger. Their mutual resignation to the parting seems awfully restrained. I expected a tearful scene of parting between mother and child, but the best we get is when Anakin asks if his mother can come along, and she replies, \"Son, my place is here.\" As a slave? The discovery and testing of Anakin supplies the film's most important action, but in a sense all the action is equally important, because it provides platforms for special-effects sequences. Sometimes our common sense undermines a sequence (for instance, when Jar Jar's people and the good guys fight a 'droid army, it becomes obvious that the droids are such bad fighters, they should be returned for a refund). But mostly I was happy to drink in the sights on the screen, in the same spirit that I might enjoy \"Metropolis,\" \"Forbidden Planet,\" \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" \"Dark City\" or \"The Matrix.\" The difference is that Lucas' visuals are more fanciful and his film's energy level is more cheerful; he doesn't share the prevailing view that the future is a dark and lonely place.\r\n\r\nWhat he does have, in abundance, is exhilaration. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of \"The Phantom Menace,\" as he tries out new effects and ideas, and seamlessly integrates real characters and digital ones, real landscapes and imaginary places. We are standing at the threshold of a new age of epic cinema, I think, in which digital techniques mean that budgets will no longer limit the scope of scenes; filmmakers will be able to show us just about anything they can imagine.\r\n\r\nAs surely as Anakin Skywalker points the way into the future of \"Star Wars,\" so does \"The Phantom Menace\" raise the curtain on this new freedom for filmmakers. And it's a lot of fun. The film has correctly been given the PG rating; it's suitable for younger viewers and doesn't depend on violence for its effects. As for the bad rap about the characters--hey, I've seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. They're called \"Star Trek\" movies. Give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day.\r\n\r\n3.5/4\r\n\r\n-Rodger Ebert"

All of that is all fine, though it's the humour that makes this film tick. It isn't belly laugh worthy but from start-to-finish I was amused by the funny nature of it.\r\n\r\nThe premise is very silly, which works in its favour, with a load of things that don't quite add up, it even references that itself in the third act. That just adds to the fun, they know it's a mindless 78 minutes and make it work.\r\n\r\nThe reason it comes out so well is thanks to David Spade and John Goodman. Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha. Patrick Warburton is also decent as Kronk.\r\n\r\nIt all makes for chilled out viewing, you'll have a good time if you just sit back and enjoy it - as I did."

            "review": "\r\n\r\nThe collective fever that characterized the countdown to The Phantom Menace had long since dissipated by the time the first sequel prequel rolled off the ILM production line. Casual spectators, once stung, had decamped en masse to the newly discovered Middle-Earth, leaving George Lucas with just the few million hardcore fans - true believers who, with all the apprehension of parents at a nativity play, willed their defrocked hero back towards respectability.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly stretches in the patchy Attack Of The Clones when Lucas\u2019 flat-packed dialogue struggles to keep the hecklers quiet \u2013 Anakin\u2019s seduction of the former Queen has all the charm of a teenage lunge behind the bike-sheds and none of the feeling \u2013 but by the time climactic \u2018reel six\u2019 cranks into high gear the saga\u2019s reputation as the godfather of modern sci-fi spectacle is more or less restored. Indeed, when Yoda finally unsheathes his mini-saber and kicks Sith ass the faithful can reliably be found standing on seats hollering as if the outcome was never in doubt. But, as the little Jedi might say, in doubt it was.\r\n\r\nWhere Episode V fairly zipped around the galaxy with all the breezy confidence of youth, unafraid to travel anywhere, even dark places, the second middle child of the saga is saddled with an altogether heavier burden from which it struggles to escape. Empire hits the ground running on ice planet Hoth, Clones however, has a truly cold start to contend with, aware perhaps that the movie\u2019s most pressing task is to simply atone for the more egregious sins of Episode I. Thus, Jar Jar is quickly sidelined, the upgraded CGI Yoda gets a showcase and those damn Amidala-clones are killed off on page one. On Coruscant we also meet the grown-up \u2018Ani\u2019 - okay so he\u2019s a whiny teenager but that\u2019s still a vast improvement on the bowl-haired moppet the world was asked to root for in 1999.\r\n\r\nAlso more powerful than when last we met is Ewan McGregor\u2019s Obi-Wan, the Jedi who was simply wan in Menace is a much more forceful presence as a full-bearded Master, struggling manfully with the endless exposition and even landing the odd punchline.\r\n\r\nAs with Empire, the protagonists are separated for the second act: while Obi-Wan is busy uncovering the conspiracy of the Clones, Anakin and Padme turn into colourless clones of Han and Leia in the romance stakes. There are pleasures (Obi-Wan squares off against Jango Fett) and pitfalls (Anakin and Padme have a picnic) in roughly equal measure throughout this flabby middle act but as with Episode I mostly you get a sense of drama that is willed into being, a necessary bridge to Episode III that requires Lucas to traverse territory \u2013 romance, politics \u2013 he is simply not comfortable in.\r\n\r\nMatters improve greatly in the final forty minutes: Christopher Lee\u2019s Count Dooku arrives to provide some much needed gravitas, C-3PO turns up to do his C-3PO thing and Padme puts on a skin-tight white leotard. Best of all, Lucas finally cuts loose. The classic trilogy bristled with seat-of-your-pants filmmaking, our heroes bouncing from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, and in the final section of Episode II \u2013 almost four hours into this prequel enterprise - Lucas at last cranks up to this Saturday morning serial pace: from the Tex Avery goofiness of the droid factory, to the Cecil B. De Mille grandeur of the gladiator arena, the action never lets up.\r\n\r\nAlso in the last reel we finally get to divine something of Lucas\u2019 grand design, with ironic pay-offs for the fans still paying close attention - it is the witless Jar Jar who makes the creation of a clone army possible and Yoda who first leads what will become Stormtroopers into battle. In its own way, the end of Episode II is every bit as dark as the famous end of Episode V.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the least anticipated movie of the saga suffered at the box office \u2013 Episode IV raked in more money at the US box office back in 1977 \u2013 and remains largely unloved by the fanbase for its emphasis on the central love story but despite no real improvement in dialogue or acting it functions perfectly well as an old fashioned romantic epic, complete with standalone set-pieces, rich political intrigue and a painters\u2019 pallette. Indeed, so indebted is Lucas to David O. Selznick here, ultimately he may have been better served abandoning his own trilogy structure and boiling both Episodes I and II down to a 3-hour Gone With The Wind style classic \u2013 an approach that would have at least halved all that damn anticipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The middle episode that can make a virtue of its bridging role is rare indeed. And where The Empire Strikes Back dazzled with vertiginous cliffhangers, Clones is more typical of the breed, necessary but not vital. However, as we make the awkward journey through Anakin\u2019s teenage trials a sparkling digital print ensures there is still much to marvel at, not least a little green fella who is surprisingly quick on the draw.\r\n\r\n3/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine"

            "review": "George Lucas comes full circle in more ways than one in \"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith,\" which is the sixth -- and allegedly but not necessarily the last -- of the \"Star Wars\" movies. After \"Episode II\" got so bogged down in politics that it played like the Republic covered by C-Span, \"Episode III\" is a return to the classic space opera style that launched the series. Because the story leads up to where the original \"Star Wars\" began, we get to use the immemorial movie phrase, \"This is where we came in.\"\r\n\r\nThat Anakin Skywalker abandoned the Jedi and went over to the dark side is known to all students of \"Star Wars.\" That his twins Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia would redeem the family name is also known. What we discover in \"Episode III\" is how and why Anakin lost his way -- how a pleasant and brave young man was transformed into a dark, cloaked figure with a fearsome black metal face. As Yoda sadly puts it in his inimitable word order: \"The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.\"\r\n\r\nAs \"Episode III\" opens, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are piloting fighter craft, staging a daring two-man raid to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). He has been captured by the rebel Gen. Grievous (whose voice, by Matthew Woods, sounds curiously wheezy considering the general seems to use replacement parts). In the spirit of all the \"Star Wars\" movies, this rescue sequence flies in the face of logic, since the two pilots are able to board Grievous' command ship and proceed without much trouble to the ship's observation tower, where the chancellor is being held. There is a close call in an elevator shaft, but where are the guards and the security systems? And why, for that matter, does a deep space cruiser need an observation tower, when every porthole opens on to the universe? But never mind.\r\n\r\nBack within the sphere of the Jedi Council, Anakin finds that despite his heroism, he will not yet be named a Jedi Master. The council distrusts Palpatine and wants Anakin to spy on him; Palpatine wants Anakin to spy on the council. Who to choose? McDiarmid has the most complex role in the movie as he plays on Anakin's wounded ego. Anakin is tempted to go over to what is not yet clearly the dark side; in a movie not distinguished for its dialogue, Palpatine is insidiously snaky in his persuasiveness.\r\n\r\nThe way Anakin approaches his choice, however, has a certain poignancy. Anakin has a rendezvous with Padme (Natalie Portman); they were secretly married in the previous film, and now she reveals she is pregnant. His reaction is that of a nice kid in a teenage comedy, trying to seem pleased while wondering how this will affect the other neat stuff he gets to do. To say that George Lucas cannot write a love scene is an understatement; greeting cards have expressed more passion.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point: The characters talk in what sounds like Basic English, without color, wit or verbal delight, as if they were channeling Berlitz. The exceptions are Palpatine and of course Yoda, whose speech (voiced by Frank Oz) reminds me of Wolcott Gibbs' famous line about the early style of Time magazine: \"Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn many cases the actors are being filmed in front of blue screens, with effects to be added later, and sometimes their readings are so flat, they don't seem to believe they're really in the middle of amazing events. How can you stand in front of exploding star fleets and sound as if you're talking on a cell phone at Starbucks?\r\n\r\n\"He's worried about you,\" Anakin is told at one point. \"You've been under a lot of stress.\" Sometimes the emphasis in sentences is misplaced. During the elevator adventure in the opening rescue, we hear \"Did I miss something?\" when it should be \"Did I miss something?\"\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is not the point, however; Lucas' characters engage in sturdy oratorical pronunciamentos and then leap into adventure. \"Episode III\" has more action per square minute, I'd guess, than any of the previous five movies, and it is spectacular. The special effects are more sophisticated than in the earlier movies, of course, but not necessarily more effective.\r\n\r\nThe dogfight between fighters in the original \"Star Wars\" and the dogfight that opens this one differ in their complexity (many more ships this time, more planes of action, more detailed backgrounds) but not in their excitement. And although Lucas has his characters attend a futuristic opera that looks like a cross between Cirque de Soleil and an ultrasound scan of an unborn baby, if you regard the opera hall simply as a place, it's not as engaging as the saloon on Tatooine in the first movie.\r\n\r\nThe lesson, I think, is that special effects should be judged not by their complexity but by the degree that they stimulate the imagination, and \"Episode III\" is distinguished not by how well the effects are done, but by how amazingly they are imagined. A climactic duel on a blazing volcanic planet is as impressive, in its line, as anything in \"Lord of the Rings.\" And Yoda, who began life as a Muppet but is now completely animated (like about 70 percent of what we see onscreen), was to begin with and still is the most lifelike of the non-humanoid \"Star Wars\" characters.\r\n\r\nA word, however, about the duels fought with lightsabers. When they flashed into life with a mighty whizzing thunk in the first \"Star Wars\" and whooshed through their deadly parabolas, that was exciting. But the thrill is gone.\r\n\r\nThe duelists are so well-matched that saber fights go on forever before anyone is wounded, and I am still not sure how the sabers seem able to shield their bearers from attack. When it comes to great movie sword fights, Liam Neeson and Tim Roth took home the gold medal in \"Rob Roy\" (1995), and the lightsaber battles in \"Episode III\" are more like isometrics.\r\n\r\nThese are all, however, more observations than criticisms. George Lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own. His \"Star Wars\" movies are among the most influential, both technically and commercially, ever made. And they are fun. If he got bogged down in solemnity and theory in \"Episode II: Attack of the Clones,\" the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and \"Revenge of the Sith\" is a great entertainment.\r\n\r\nNote: I said this is not necessarily the last of the \"Star Wars\" movies. Although Lucas has absolutely said he is finished with the series, it is inconceivable to me that 20th Century-Fox will willingly abandon the franchise, especially as Lucas has hinted that parts VII, VIII and IX exist at least in his mind. There will be enormous pressure for them to be made, if not by him, then by his deputies.\r\n\r\n4.5/5\r\n\r\n- Rodger Ebert"

            "review": "Beauty and the beast in Maine during WWII\r\n\r\nOn the surface \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d (1999) is a quality period piece about life at an apple orchard and orphanage in Maine during WWII. Tobey Maguire stars as Homer Wells, who was raised at a remote orphanage and favored by caretaker Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who imparts his vast medical knowledge & skills to the young man. At the age of 21 Homer decides to leave the orphanage with a couple that stopped by for an illegal abortion and ends up working at an apple orchard. Will he ever return?\r\n\r\nIt's the subtext where the film soars for those interested in ruminations on the complexities of morality and the place that outward or inward rules play.\r\n\r\nHere's a taste: The movie contrasts outer rules with innate moral rules. The former can be broken as it suits the individual without any ill-effects, like the cider house rules in the film or stepping over the wall at Niagara Falls to get a better picture; innate moral rules, however, cannot be broken without severe consequences. To illustrate, the apple workers rightly mock the cider house rules made by people who don't know what it's like to live & work there, but one laborer breaks a universal spiritual law and so loses a close relationship and something worse, which conveys the idea that \"the wages of sin is death.\"\r\n\r\nAnother example involves the rules of society demanding that a person have proper credentials in order to do the work Dr. Larch performs, and understandably so, but official credentials on a wall are irrelevant in regards to some people, like Homer, who's thoroughly expert at his craft, credentials or no credentials. And so Larch creates fake \"proper\" credentials to appease officials and patients.\r\n\r\nAlso, Wally & Candy (Paul Rudd & Charlize Theron) impulsively have an illegal abortion at the beginning of the movie but, by the end, it doesn't look like they're going to have very wild sex anymore (which is different than saying they won't have any sexual relations). They no doubt strongly regret deciding to break the rules and have an abortion, which was illegal at the time.\r\n\r\nObviously the movie's not far Left or far Right; it's somewhere in the middle in its realistic reflections on moral complexities and ambiguities. Both sides of the abortion debate, for instance, are presented. And, while it could be argued that the movie somewhat supports the pro-choice position, it doesn\u2019t neglect to convey the conservative view and effectively shows how the debate is more complex than black or white. For example, if a man forces his self on a woman and she gets pregnant, the life within her is not there by her choice and therefore she arguably has the right to abort that life with the blood of the child being on the head of the impregnating male.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Homer argues the conservative position, suggesting that people should be responsible enough to control themselves BEFORE a woman is impregnated and the ugly issue of abortion rears its head. Dr. Larch later remarks that he wishes the world were as idealistic as Homer sees it, but instead we\u2019re stuck with an intricately phukked up planet where people make wrong choices all the time, which have a negative domino effect.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in Northampton, Massachusetts (orphanage); Dummerston, Vermont (orchard); Bernard, Corea and Sand Beach, Maine; as well as surrounding New England locations.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being \"because we don't understand it, lets destroy it\" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10\r\n\r\nVoice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M. Emmet Walsh and Eli Marienthal."

The environments remain beautiful, the living creatures may not look quite as superb but are still nice in my opinion. The voice cast are understated yet suitable, much like everything else from the music to the plot.\r\n\r\nD. B. Sweeney plays the lead role, portraying a character called Aladar. His voice isn't as strong as I'd want but he does a good job nevertheless. Alfre Woodard stands out slightly as Plio, I recognised her voice instantly having seen her years back on TV's <em>'Desperate Housewives'</em>.\r\n\r\nHeftier voices and a more dramatic score would've taken this further in my estimations, though there's no doubting this is a film that has many elements to enjoy."

At times it's jaunty when the scene appears to call for menace, and at others just plain boring if the scene was meant to be actually funny (in that sarcastic, almost satirical way). The film could have worked at either being a comedy or a thriller, but the fusion of the two just doesn't work, and this failing has to fall at Williamson's door, it's as if Scream was all a fluke after all? The cast struggle with the meanderingly dull screenplay, only the stoic (and sexy) Helen Mirren salvaging any sort of dignity by realising early on that the core of the film calls for deft nastiness instead of outright villainy.\r\n\r\nPoor and practically unwatchable these days. 2/10"

            "review": "Unequivocally, unmistakably, undeniably Disney's greatest animated film. A masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned. Long read ahead!\r\n\r\nFilm and reviews are all about opinions, which is only a positive thing. I, for one, though have yet to find a better animation than this. No doubt I'm probably partly clouded by nostalgia, but even a tonne of years later I still remember how blown away I was when I first watched it. Nothing's changed.\r\n\r\nWhere to start? I love every single detail about this film, for which there are many. Not only does it improve upon the studio's earlier 1950 production about Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel, but it manages to create an incredibly touching, amusing and rather thrilling story for all. They don't rely on the usual, overdone Disney front and center romance to do it either.\r\n\r\nIt's a story of a young kid coming-of-age into the world. You really go on a journey with Jim Hawkins, who hadn't had the most happiest childhood. We see him grow into a man across just 95 short minutes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings Jim to life superbly, no surprise to see he has done other great things in his career.\r\n\r\nGordon-Levitt isn't the only outstanding performer here, with Brian Murray and Emma Thompson showing their talents in the roles of John Silver and Capt. Amelia. I adore the dynamic between Silver and Hawkins, Murray is truly brilliant. Thompson is great in her role, also.\r\n\r\nEven below those aforementioned names, you have memorable characters in Delbert (David Hyde Pierce), B.E.N. (Martin Short) and Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne). Morph (Dane Davis) is a cracking little sidekick, too.\r\n\r\nAway from the cast, you also have the sensational animation. They mix hand-drawn 2D and computer generated 3D, which comes out exquisitely. Sure some of it hasn't aged impeccably compared to now, but it all to this day still looks utterly stunning. I love the attention to detail.\r\n\r\nThat's not all. How about that music? I couldn't tell you the amount of times I've listened to that soundtrack down the years, it's so beautifully crafted by James Newton Howard and John Rzeznik; the latter's, as part of the Goo Goo Dolls, \"I'm Still Here\" fits so, so well.\r\n\r\nCan you tell how much fondness I hold for this? It's fantastic! Did Disney mishandle it? Sure. Does it deserves more respect? Definitely. However, I'm kinda glad they just let Ron Clements and John Musker do their thing. Heavy Disney interference could've ruined it. The fact this has zero pointless sequels is marvellous, even if it's for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nThere are minor rumours they plan to live-action this. Normally I'd argue against classics being remade, but I think this 2002 production is in a win-win position in that regard. If it's a big success it'll be good for it, if it's terrible then it'll put more eyes on the original.\r\n\r\nIt's kinda funny, I don't see myself as a Disney fan and yet my two favourites films (this + <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em>) are from this studio - and both pirate-y, interestingly. Hmm.\r\n\r\nGo watch <em>'Treasure Planet'</em>!"

I'm seeing all these characters I loved, and just feeling nothing.  I'm hearing these (fantastic, voice-acting) ladies doing baby voice, and I've seen other movies where ladies do baby voice and they're just not nearly as long as this one.\r\n\r\nI might have been able to get into the movie as it actually has a decent story (thought it focuses on the parents more than I'm used to), but they decided to play with rules that involve how babies talk.  They clearly present new-born babies that not only talk, but talk eloquently about \"Missing their old womb\" (sounds like a baby saying \"room\").  Dill, barely talks.  in fact, he talks to the babies like the babies would talk to the adults, and they refer to him as a baby.\r\n\r\nWhile they should be toddlers and speaking a lot more than they should, part of the premise is that they're babies that talk to each other, but not adults.  It almost paints the picture that Dill was born retarded, but refuses to address it, even if it applies it directly.\r\n\r\nIt really broke the movie for me, as it's the chief mechanic behind the babies' A story line that is the basis for the parents' B story line."

            "review": "Oh the irony of it all...\r\n\r\nAfter surviving the second wave of ghostface killings, Sidney Prescott has retired to the mountains to live in peace and work as a phone call therapist. Sadly for her she is about to be dragged back into the nightmare because the production of Stab 3 is rocked by murder and the killer is leaving pictures of Sidney's dead mother at the crime scenes.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I once never gave this film much love, I loved the first two to such a degree that I felt this third and final instalment was way off being a fitting closure to what was at the time a trilogy. Yet as time has wore on I have really grown fond of the film, Parker Posey no longer annoys the hell out of me, the once jarring itch of watching the makers kill off a fave character of mine in the opening sequence is something I now view as a masterstroke, and the twisty ending that was once an irksome pest has moved on to be the perfect \"trilogy\" closure.\r\n\r\nScream 3 has its tongue firmly in its cheek, it's aware of its number and it's aware of its formulaic root, so in spite of treading familiar ground (I mean come on gang, have you not learnt nothing from your previous experiences), the returning characters still have our undivided attention. While the transporting of the story to Hollywood, with its movie within a movie structure, is fresh and adds a new dimension to proceedings. New additions to the scary fun are Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Lance Henriksen and the afore mentioned Parker Posey, and all of them add greatly to the mysterious plot unfolding.\r\n\r\nThe death quotient is still high, and the Wes Craven school of whodunitry is well and truly open, and I personally feel that this one is easily the funniest film of the three, witness Jay & Silent Bob turning up, a Carrie Fisher sequence that once heard will never be forgotten, and a video appearance by passed on geek god Randy Meeks. Scream 3 closes the \"trilogy\" just fine, it's got bags of energy and a glint in its eye, now if only I could get a copy of the uncompleted Stab 3 off the internet - and if only there wasn't to be a part 4 further down the line... 7/10"

            "review": "I'd be bad meat \u2013 pretty well rotted to a glob.\r\n\r\nRide with the Devil is directed by Ang Lee and adapted to screenplay by James Schamus (also producer) from the novel \"Woe to Live On\" written by Daniel Woodrell. It stars Tobey Maguire, Skeet Ulrich, Jeffrey Wright, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Simon Baker, James Caviezel and Jewel. Music is by Mychael Danna and cinematography by Frederick Elmes.\r\n\r\n\"On the Western Frontier of Missouri, the American Civil War was fought not by armies, but by neighbours. Informal gangs of local Southern Bushwhackers fought a bloody and desperate Guerrilla war against the occupying Union Army and pro-Union Jayhawkers. Allegiance to either side was dangerous. But it was more dangerous still to find oneself caught in the middle\"\r\n\r\nMade for $38 million and intended to be a sweeping epic for the summer blockbuster crowd, Ride with the Devil was a considerable financial flop. With a limited release both in America and abroad, the financial figures are hardly surprising. More so considering it was given next to no promotion by the distributors. Factor in a little controversy about the events featured in the story, some cuts made by the studio (Lee didn't have final cut) and a delay in home release formats because the distributor incredibly wanted Jeffrey Wright's presence removed from the cover art! Well you would be forgiven for thinking that the film has to be something of a stinker. Not so say I.\r\n\r\nPart rites of passage drama, part reflective war movie, Ang Lee's film is a grand film viewing experience. Dealing as it does with the often forgotten part of the war down on the Missouri/Kansas border, where Lee also shoots on location, film manages to be both savage and lyrical in equal measure. The savagery comes with the fights, bloody, frenetic and high on potency, while the lyricism comes with the human relationships, internal conflicts and the political awareness of the men (boys) fighting for their cause. All given deft treatment by Schamus, whose screenplay contains crisp period dialogue and a narrative correctly showing that this part of the war was not just driven by racist Dixie's hell bent on revenge, violent lust and political allegiance, but often for family, land and rights. Picture is at pains to let us know the youth of the main characters, ramming home the point of boys forced to become men, killing machines, very quickly. Case in point, the culmination of the violence in the film that comes by way of the Lawrence Massacre, a tragic and upsetting slaughter that saw 180 people murdered under the leadership of a vengeful William Quantrill (John Ales). Lee and Schamus aren't interested in showing heroism in this particular war, they show it as futile, nasty and it leaves the taste of bile in the throat.\r\n\r\nFrom here the film slows considerably, as the lead characters withdraw from the action of war, to awakenings and friendships forming. It's here where Lee is at his best. No great director of action, as evidenced by the previously mentioned Lawrence Massacre; which lacks the cutting edge to really grab us by the throat and never let go, but for human interest aspects and bucolic scenes with characters framed within, Lee owes film fans absolutely nothing. The latter of which he is aided considerably by Elmes' widescreen photography. Ulrich and pop star Jewel nicely handle their parts, he puts a confident swagger into Jack Bull Chiles, she is tender and unassuming in the pivotal female role of Sue Lee Shelley. Caviezel gives Black John Ambrose a brooding menace, while Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is on overdrive as sadistic loony Pitt Mackeson. But it's with Maguire and Wright that the acting plaudits go. Maguire has arguably never been better, he gives Jake Roedel an effective sensitivity as a virginal boy receives a violent initiation into manhood. Wright is sublime, said to be one of his favourite performances, Wright as freed slave Daniel Holt is the heart beat of the film. Conveying most of the good traits available to man, Holt fights not just out of loyalty to his friend George Clyde (Baker), but to gain ultimate catharsis in is life. It's a beautiful measured turn from Wright, and it deserves more appreciative attention. \r\n\r\nThe last third of it may be too talky for some, and a couple of dangling narrative threads left unanswered stop it from being a masterpiece. But it's close to being just that, a savage, beautiful and lyrical movie. The stupid studio execs had no idea: Putz's. 9/10"

            "review": "Into the perverse underworld of smut, S&M and snuff films\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1999 and directed by Joel Schumacher, \"8MM\" chronicles events when a private investigator (Nicolas Cage) is hired by an aged wealthy woman whose husband recently passed away. A snuff film was found in his safe and she wants to see if the girl in the movie (Jenny Powell) really died or not. Amy Morton appears as the girl\u2019s mother while Joaquin Phoenix plays a wannabe rock musician in Los Angeles who works in the porn trade. Catherine Keener is on hand as the P.I.\u2019s wife. \r\n \r\nThe movie combines the basic plot of \u201cHardcore\u201d (1979) with the style of late 90\u2019s crime thrillers, like \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d (1997). The first half involves the P.I.\u2019s tracking down the makers of the snuff film. While it\u2019s tedious work (which I wouldn\u2019t want to do) this part of the movie is gritty and compelling. The second half of the movie goes into material that\u2019s difficult to pull off with a straight face, like the smut-obsessed underbelly of Los Angeles & New York. The main villains come off cartoonish somehow rather than gritty realistic, but it\u2019s a fine line.  \r\n\r\nStill, I like the message of the movie. My wife & I knew a wealthy man who passed away a few years ago. He often didn\u2019t pay the people he did business with, not to mention his employees who were living paycheck to paycheck. Someone asked him how he could own two Cadillacs and regularly go on globetrotting vacations while treating people like this and he arrogantly responded: \u201cBecause I caaAAAN.\u201d The low-lifes in \u201c8MM\u201d have a similar attitude.      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 3 minutes and was shot in Miami, Pennsylvania (Wormleysburg/Harrisburg), New York (Hastings-on-Hudson, Elmsford, Yonkers, Queens & Long Island) and S. Cal. (Los Angeles & Long Beach). WRITER: Andrew Kevin Walker. ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Heald plays the rich woman\u2019s lawyer while James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare and Chris Bauer appear as smut pervs.   \r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

            "review": "***The Stepford Teens, sort of***\r\n\r\nWhen a Chicago family moves to an island in the Puget Sound, Washington, Steve (James Marsden) encounters the usual cliques at his new high school, but there\u2019s something odd about the Blue Ribbon Club, a circle of high-achieving students who get a pass from the police when they screw-up. Nick Stahl plays Steve\u2019s new friend, Katie Holmes a potential girlfriend and Katharine Isabelle his sister. Bruce Greenwood is on hand as a dubious school psychologist.   \r\n\r\nThe set-up of \u201cDisturbing Behavior\u201d (1998) is similar to the same in \u201cTwilight\u201d (2008), but there are no vampires and werewolves. I won\u2019t say more about the plot, except that it includes elements of Dr. Frankenstein and \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d (1975). This isn\u2019t really giving much away as the movie telegraphs everything from the get-go and so is kind of predictable. \r\n\r\nYet the Great Northwest locations are spectacular, the cast is good, particularly Marsden and Stahl, and the story is compelling enough. It\u2019s just laden by a been-there, done-that vibe. Still, it\u2019s way superior to the similar \u201cThe Faculty\u201d (1998), not to mention more serious. It\u2019s also arguably better than comparable flicks from the time period, like \u201cScream\u201d (1996), \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d (1997), \u201cI Still Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d (1998), \u201cUrban Legend\u201d (1998), \u201cJawbreaker\u201d (1999) and \u201cFinal Destination\u201d (2000).  \u201cBad Girls from Valley High\u201d is on par (which was shot in 1999, but not released until 2005). \r\n\r\nThe original length was 115 minutes, about 32 minutes longer than the released version, but producers found it too long and so cut out scenes that supposedly helped the movie to make more sense. Personally, I didn\u2019t feel the movie was hard to grasp and never felt lost. But the last act needed more finesse because it does seem awkward and rushed; for instance, the mental hospital sequence flashes by so quickly you might miss it if you blink.         \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, including Bowen Island.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

            "review": "All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.\r\n\r\nPitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. \r\n\r\nThe year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. \r\n\r\nRight from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... \r\n\r\nOkies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade \"A\" from those involved. \r\n\r\nIt's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. \r\n\r\nThe narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the \u00e9p\u00e9e to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. \r\n\r\nThe setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... \r\n\r\nThe science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10"

Director's coming and going, one (Walter Hill) taking his name off the credits, butchery by studio interference, different endings, different planned thematics, shelved for two years and etc. Supernova was a messy production and sadly it shows, making Walter Hill's original cut (unavailable) the \"Magnificent Ambersons\" of the sci-fi genre.\r\n\r\nPlot, in the skew-whiff edited version we are fed here, is basically a riff on Ridley Scott's Alien. Space dudes up in space take on board a too good to be true hitch-hiker dude, which is a bad idea. Sadly it's all very dull, yet strangely you can see that in amongst the mess, and the often used diversion tactic of Robin Tunney's breasts, there was a very good film here. Brains and effects work to light up the screen, some sexy sizzle marrying up to the tension up there in the galaxy, James Spader on wonderfully broody and heroically damaged form, and some belting deleted scenes on the DVD. But, it's not to be, so the studio should be ashamed of themselves, even if it isn't quite the ultimate stinker it has been painted as. But! Super it is not, in any shape or form. 5/10"
