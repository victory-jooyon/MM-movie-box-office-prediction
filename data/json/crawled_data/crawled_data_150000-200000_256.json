Forced to go on the run, and haunted by a family tragedy, Anderton must evade the system he so perfectly executed himself. Can he find a flaw? Or is he actually about to commit a murder?\r\n\r\nEverybody Runs! That was the tag line that accompanied the explosive trailer for Steven Spielberg's, Tom Cruise starrer, Minority Report. This marketing tool indicated that the great bearded one had adapted from the Phillip K Dick short story and created an action monster? He hadn't, he had in fact created something far far better than popcorn fodder.\r\n\r\nMinority Report was the next project for Spielberg following the equally dark and intriguing AI: Artificial Intelligence, both films serving to note that Spielberg was capable of thought provoking science fiction outside of the standard crowd pleasers that many critics love to decry. In fact, it's arguable that Spielberg may have hit his creative peak with Minority Report, for the messages and crawling dystopian bleakness on show paint a picture not so much as a future far away in our lives, but of one we live in now. Big thematic points of reference dot themselves throughout the piece. Such as the changing of eye balls, or that in these post 9/11 years we yearn, and always will, to be safer.\r\n\r\nHere in this bleached shadowy world, a world of metallic tones and visual stings (ace cinematographer Janusz Kaminski on duty), we are safe under Pre-Crime. Yet still it's a world without soul, it has no heart, it's almost as if inhuman in itself, suggesting that the World's problems are not easily vanquished by technology - a total sacrifice of the World's inhabitant's souls. Spielberg of course is well served by the supreme professionals he has at his disposal, he has also managed to garner a great performance from Tom Cruise, something that critic and fan favourite directors have not managed to do previously. Believable grief, action work as strong as ever, it is however with his ability to imbue a tortured film noir protagonist where Cruise excels the most.\r\n\r\nAlongside Cruise and operating with great impact are Samantha Morton as Pre-Cog Agatha and Max Von Sydow, the latter adding that touch of experienced know how needed for his particularly important character. The odd casting choice appeared to be Colin Farrell as the meddling, almost vindictive Danny Witwer, but he plays well off of Cruise, this even if he veers dangerously close to comic book villainy at times (check out a holy smoke Batman scene). What action there is is first rate, from a jet back pack pursuit, to car jumping heroics, the sequences are crafted with Spielberg's deft eye for an action sequence. While the sick sticks (yes you read right) metal spiders and a brilliant Peter Stormare cameo should hopefully have you squirming and grinning in equal measure.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the finale, an ending that may not be a complete surprise (yet it still doesn't cop-out in context to Anderton's tragedy), but things are rounded off in true classic noir tradition, where it closes down a thinking man's tech-noir. Superb. 9/10"

            "review": "SPOILERS \r\n\r\nUnder-rated, worthy chapter to the story, with surprisingly provocative ideas and some stellar acting.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie admittedly has neither the grit of T1 nor the grand vision or pathos of T2, I'd like to share what I believe to be three elements which together cement T3's place in the canon of the Terminator franchise.\r\n\r\nThe first is the way the actors acted the relationship between Connor and the T-800. While Connor has memories that we the audience recall from T2, the T-800, played by Arnold, was not the same T-800 from T2. This is just another machine from off an assembly line of T-800s that were manufactured. Yeah, Arnold looks like Arnold, but this T-800 has no memory of the previous installment because it was not there. And he acts disconnected, distant and mechanical, betraying zero connection to Connor. That was really cool, and helped we the audience appreciate that, where the T-800 comes from, is a much bigger place than we had heretofore really digested. We only ever saw one or two at a time back in our time; the reality we had not yet seen by the time of T3, is that the future was full of these things, and there's nothing personal about them. We the audience wanted to reconnect to all the good feelings from the end of T2, we wanted to get personal with these machines, and that's really hard to do. This movie smacked us back to \"reality\".\r\n\r\nThe second aspect is that this is the movie that puts the transition to SkyNet into a context that we could see. Now we know why and how the government handed control over to SkyNet. T3 displayed what we'd heard a little about in T1, and a little more about in T2, but it did so in a way that did not prompt much in the way of \"where did that come from?\" or \"what are they talking about\" that I've ever come across (Terminator Salvation failed test this miserably, spectacularly).\r\n\r\nThe third and final aspect of the movie that, for me, was rather provocative is that, right up to the end, we the audience are following the stubborn view of Connor that judgment day can be stopped. He was sure they'd stopped it at the end of T2. He was sure they were racing to stop it throughout T3...but, if we the audience stopped ourselves from being emotionally carried away, we'd have come to the realization Connor did earlier that judgment day could not be stopped. The terminators kept coming back from the future because the technology had advanced to where it was both possible and necessary. So judgment day did happen, and the terminator being there meant it couldn't be stopped.\r\n\r\nIs T3 the best in the franchise? Heck no! C'mon, I'm not totally crazy. Is it the worst? I don't think so, at all. (I, personally, lay that crown on Terminator Salvation, but I digress...) T2 is the best, for me, for a few reasons. T1 is the honourable second because it started the story and set up many of the devices that would help make T2 among the great sequals of all time - right up there with Godfather 2 and Star Wars Episode 2, and Blade II :-)"

            "review": "Hopes, Dreams & Nightmares.\r\n\r\nAlmost Famous is Cameron Crowe's paean to rock music, of bands and songs, of journalism and promotion, of sex & drugs. Drawing from experience and stories passed on, Crowe tells the tale of a young teenage boy aspiring to be a music journalist in the 1970s. Finding himself backstage with the rock group Stillwater, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) embarks on a road journey with the band that's awash with egos, groupies, perils and pleasures, all of which change his life forever.\r\n\r\nLets go find something real!\r\n\r\nThe most striking thing about it is that it's not overtly funny or sensationalistic, it's a production that's full of love, real love, for the subject matters to hand, and it's very often a moving experience to be part of. Narratively speaking, Crowe takes his time, steadily building characters and backdrop essentials, it works a treat as we become immersed in all the major players within the music circle, while also feeling the concerns of those on the outside of the rock group circle. Which of course gives us the great rewards come the final third of film when all matters come to a head. Crowe and his design team also work some magic for period flavours, capturing the early 70s vibe with awareness of clothing, food and drink and transport. Nothing ever seems false, which is remarkable in this era of product placements and shameless plugging. \r\n\r\n50 bucks and a case of beer! \r\n\r\nAnother one of Crowe's strengths is how he garners great performances from his actors. There's no big stars here, no Tom or Ren\u00e9e, but Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Kate Hudson and Fugit, who respond to their director with sincere and believable performances, no caricatures or ham sarnies here, no way. While outskirt performances from Frances McDormand (brilliant as William's fretful mother), Anna Paquin, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the legendary Lester Bangs) and Fairuza Balk, consistently hit the hi-hat. The music of course rocks, from metal and progers, to folkers and bubblegum, to some punk godfathery, these sounds feature on the soundtrack and kick the decade into orbit - while the Stillwater scenes are effective and the use of Elton John's Tiny Dancer will land in your heart and stay there.\r\n\r\nCameron Crowe has created a smashingly memorable film that will stand the tests of time. Two cuts are available, where both the theatrical and director's cuts are sure fire things (the latter Bootleg Cut my personal favourite). This is a music based film to sit with the best of them, God Bless Rock N Roll and God Bless Cameron Crowe, for he could have easily embellished and over egged his rock pudding, instead he kept it real. 9/10"

While hiking across the desert, they speculate that the planet is inhabited only by women. Murat does his \"wolf whistle\", which he uses on attractive women. However, he blows the wrong whistle and they are attacked by skeletons on horseback, which they defeat in hand-to-hand combat. The main villain soon shows up and captures the heroes, bringing them to his gladiatorial arena so they can fight. The villain tells them he is actually from Earth and is a 1,000 year old wizard. He tried to defeat Earth, but was always repelled by a shield of concentrated human brain molecules, which looks like the Death Star from Star Wars. The only way he can bypass this impenetrable defense is to use a human brain against it.",

Plenty of sci-fi around but sadly few decent offerings.\r\n\r\nMission to Mars is a film you can see had good ideas on the page, some brainy and emotion based narrative threads. Effects work is OK for the era, while there's a very impressive cast put together to tell the story. Yet the script stinks to high heaven, the surprises are as absent as Martians are, while the steals from previous sci-fi movies grate on the nerves. The odd sequence has quality about it (dancing in space, woo-hoo, storm attack, yay), while the finale - all be it still a steal - is well constructed and further proof that someone somewhere had the kernel of a good story idea, but it's laborious trite and devoid of the basic film principals - to entertain and engage.\r\n\r\nSo many things wrong here, so much so the names of all involved have been spared. Join this Mission to Mars at your own peril. 4/10"

            "review": "Phone Booth dials up its millennial tension through suspenseful confined calls. Joel Schumacher is a rather inconsistent director. Unusual, yet capricious. From \u2018The Lost Boys\u2019 to \u2018Batman & Robin\u2019, his career has been considerably scattershot in terms of quality. Phone Booth, whilst quintessentially being a product of its time, happens to be his most simplistic. An arrogant publicist is held hostage in a phone booth by a mysterious sniper who offers him an ultimatum.\r\n\r\nA hyperbolised exercise in absolution from an absurdist\u2019s perspective, Schumacher delivers a nail-biting thriller from the confinement of one besmirched public booth. Unscrupulous sex shops on one side of the grubby New York street, and a religiously inclined series of posters dictating \u201cwho do you think you are?\u201d on the other side. It may just be a lightning paced disposable techno thriller to many, but if you divulge into the finer details you\u2019ll notice it is overwhelmed with morality. The repentance of sins. Cleansing the soul from immorality. The harsh tones of Sutherland\u2019s antagonistic voice, likening himself to a higher (or lower...) entity, offering Farrell\u2019s Stu a chance for redemption. A surprisingly thematic endeavour for Schumacher, whether intentional or not, the religious symbolism in its subtle visuals or literary narrative were certainly profound.\r\n\r\nIt smooths out the neo-noir roughness that forces this thriller to be nothing more than disposable entertainment. Aside from Farrell\u2019s strong performance as the arrogantly unlikeable Stu and Sutherland\u2019s menacing tone, the supporting cast were mediocre at best. Whitaker, Mitchell and Holmes rarely had an opportunity to shine within the mucky street and had a tendency to overact. The act of forgiveness, whilst being a pivotal point to the whole ordeal, seemed incredibly vacuous without much deliberate intervention. All too easy, considering how long Stu kept his unfaithful behaviour up for. Cohen\u2019s script was sharp and concise, occasionally stagnating in moments of desperation when not knowing how to progress the hostage situation further.\r\n\r\nStevens\u2019 editing was swifter than Sutherland cocking his sniper rifle multiple times. On screen graphics to display scenes running simultaneously, such as police officers tracing the encrypted phone call, keeping the pace consistently tight. Some of visuals, such as the red dot from the sniper, obviously smelt of fakery as well as the space effects showcasing the satellite sending communications to mobile phone chips etc. Y\u2019know, common tropes from films created in the early naughties.\r\n\r\nAs I said, it\u2019s very much a film of its time. Yet despite the rough disposable nature of Phone Booth, it\u2019s a much more entertaining call then being on hold for an hour and a half. I can tell you that from experience..."

Just thinking about Alan Tudyk, Heath Ledger, and Shannyn Sossamon makes me smile.\r\n\r\nEveryone plays their roles fantasticly, taking their stock characters, and spinning the writing to the 9th degree: the jerks are hate-able jerks and I can't help but love the leads and supporting characters.\r\n\r\nPart of what makes this movie disctinct is that they forces some modern (for the time) music into it when it very did not belong with medieval England / Europe.  There are several scenes where if you squint, you could mistake the movie for \"10 Things I Hate About You\" or some other teen rom com of that time period.\r\n\r\nFortunately they found a way to balance the jousting content with personality stories, which are by far more entertaining, but unless you're Kevin Smith, you can't exactly cut jousting out of a movie set in competitions for jousting.\r\n\r\nThis is a fun movie with some positive messaging in it about women and class rights, please give this a go."

They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.\r\n\r\nIt didn't dawn on me until the end that the title \"Shanghai Noon\" is a comical take on \"High Noon\" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's \"The Mummy.\" It's not as good as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", but it's better than its sequels.\r\n\r\nChan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is amusing, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood, as well as overlong.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

My fave scene when all 4 ladies were at the couch just chatting and laughing. I love all the characters (maybe not Nina). Agrado\u2026for the win! Penelope\u2026what a beautiful nun, so sad about her situation though. Huma, at first kinda off (as she didn\u2019t give the autograph to the son) but as the movie went on, I liked her character more and more. And Cecilia, very empowering. At first, the other characters were supposed to be helping the mother but in the end, she was the one who helped all of them, in a way. Feel good dramatic film."

Too much talk, too long a run time.\r\n\r\n<em>'Gone in Sixty Seconds'</em> does produce some fun action, but I personally felt an extra notch of thrill was needed with this; especially as it lasts for 118 minutes. Some parts are very ploddy, a shortened run time would've worked wonders.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage is amusing in this, his character Memphis is actually quite goofy. The cast around him are pretty good, with a whole host of familiar names/faces. Angelina Jolie appears as Sway, with Giovanni Ribisi (Kip) and Vinnie Jones (Sphinx) in there too. Christopher Eccleston, meanwhile, makes for a decent bad guy.\r\n\r\nGood fun, could've been far more entertaining though."

            "review": "Here's Mel to give the Brits an inaccurate historical thrashing, again... \r\n\r\nThe Patriot is based around one Benjamin Martin, an ex-soldier, who now happily living as a family man finds himself thrust into conflict at the break of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nHe loves the Brits does Mel Gibson, \"Gallipoli\", \"Braveheart\" and here with \"The Patriot\", see the pattern anyone? As with the aforementioned \"Gallipoli\" and \"Braveheart\", certain liberties have also been taken with events in \"The Patriot\" so as to glossy up for the eager Hollywood contingent. It's not my want to scribble about the facts of Benjamin Martin (Re: Francis Marion), or William Wallace for that matter, information as such is but a mere click away on the world wide web.\r\n\r\nSo casting aside the artistic licence factors, is \"The Patriot\" any good? Well nearly it is -- nearly. Gibson is fine, he shoulders the burden of the film with great gusto and no shortage of emotional depth. It's very easy to accept him as a staunch family man who transforms into a blood thirsty warrior. The problems, acting wise, lay away from Gibbo's central performance. Surrounded by caricature villains (though Jason Isaacs' Tavington is deliciously vile) and underwritten characters (Chris Cooper wasted and Joely Richardson is but a mere prop), Gibson has no choice but to hog the screen. So much so it ultimately turns into a one man star vehicle, which for a costume war epic isn't a great thing really.\r\n\r\nRoland Emmerich (\"Independence Day\" and \"Godzilla\") directs and handles the battle sequences very well, there's lashings of blood as men line up to shoot and dismember one and other. While cannonball's whizz, bang and tear off body parts, it's grim, yet oddly rousing stuff. Not even the overtly flag waving and sloganeering on show can off set the impact of the well constructed battles. There is of course lots of tragedy to be found in the film, and these are some what surprisingly, tenderly handled by Emmerich, but mostly it's via an on song Gibson, who remains one of the few modern day male actors capable of believable grief. All of this is given a John Williams score that suitably flits between rousing and ethereal, and things are further boosted by the sumptuous photography from Caleb Deschanel.\r\n\r\nThere should have been more thought given to the racial (slaves) aspects in the conflict, and this coupled with the bad errors of under developed characters hurts \"The Patriot\" as a filmic exercise, not so as to stop it being entertaining, but more to stop it being a one man show. But as it is, thanks in the main to Gibson, and in spite of the overtly evident faults, it's an above average drama. 6/10"

Best of all, it's filmed and choreographed with absolute mastery (thanks Donnie Yen!)\r\n\r\nGuillermo del Toro never forgets to include his more artistic side. Detailed creature anatomy, amazing creature design, an understanding of where to put the camera, and great characters. It's all here.\r\n\r\nBlade II is an incredible action picture and even though some of the CGI looks dated (it really just adds to the charm), Blade II is as exhilarating today as it was in 2002."

Murnau (John Malkovich) is filming Nosferatu (1922), but isn't reclusive star Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) taking his role of the vampire way too seriously?\r\n\r\nIn some ways it's a curate's egg of a film. It certainly helps if you are a lover of old classic film and have some knowledge of the source material at the film's core. It's a fabulous concept that the screenplay is based around, that the star of the film may actually be a real vampire, and the whole production is executed with consummate skill (Dafoe was deservedly Oscar nominated as were make-up artists Ann Buchanan & Amber Sibley). But come the end it fizzles out and proves to not have delivered on its devilishly intriguing premise. Fun, though, and tech credits all round keep one well involved. 6/10"

Peter Pau's cinematography and Dun Tan's soundtrack deservedly won two of the four Oscars, amidst its ten nominations, but even though the production values and story were the reason that this, rather than more significant martial arts classics, such as 'The 36th Chamber of Shaolin' and other Shaw Brothers' masterpieces of the genre is that it stepped outside the box and became mandatory viewing for both genders and all cultures with its love story, in the same way that 'Rocky' isn't simply a boxing movie. Still fascinating watching today, and the scene in which the restaurant is destroyed is one of the most fascinating set-pieces I have yet seen."

            "review": "Campy, amusing heroic fantasy with \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 dungeons and dragons.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, \"Dungeons & Dragons\" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).  \r\n \r\nThe first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that it\u2019s not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of \u201cStar Wars\u201d (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you\u2019d have a good idea of what \u201cDungeons & Dragons\u201d has to offer. \r\n\r\nThis was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel \u201cWrath of the Dragon God\u201d (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but it\u2019s decidedly TV fantasy fare.\r\n\r\nThe film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.                                 \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic (Kutn\u00e1 Hora and Prague). WRITERS: Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

Celebrating the Everyman who never got his shot, The Replacements takes the Mediocre and gives them their chance in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts out with the professional football players going on strike, mid-season, to demand even more money to play a kid's game. The league owners decide to finish out the season with whatever players they can acquire (mirroring the 1987 NFL strike). The Washington Sentinels' owner goes a completely different direction by re-hiring one of his old coaches and giving him complete control of the team. Coach McGinty then goes about putting together his Dream Team of Wanna-Be's and Never-Were's who, if the stars aligned just right, might just reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nAn EXCELLENT popcorn movie that would have received 5 stars if there had been more football in the football movie. Nevertheless, it is packed full of great one-liners (He's Wiry) and will have you tossing off non-sequiturs the next day all day long. That'll do pig. That'll do."

            "review": "Attempting to finish film school, a director doing her film about a serial killer killing his victims on urban legends starts to realize that a serial killer is running around behind the scenes killing off the crew, and must stop the madman before killing off everyone on the film.\r\n\r\nThis here was a pretty surprising entry. One of the things it does well is that it really features a lot of suspenseful work at times as this makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a-movie trick to nice effect, since it features enough to make hard to distinguish one from the other including it's wonderful opening sequence that takes a while before realizing after the fact it's been faked, a sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies only for a strange cut-shot to play where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened where all but one thinking it to be shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and a later scene where a murder done during the recording of a scream-test loud enough to drown out the victim's own being great scenes. Even going away from that formula, there\u2019s some rather fun stalking here from the bathroom chase featuring the woman trying to escape from the killer out into the alleyway or a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool while an attack at a carnival ride hidden by the darkness and fog comes off rather nice as well. The final confrontation in the movie-set graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast with the true revelation and the different twists featured throughout make for a nice time here. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills, which along with the mask worn are the film's rather good parts. This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing has a lot of ways for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on. These here are the film's flaws.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and a sex scene."

Please, don't ask me to give it up.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on a real case and is about real people so to that ends it is obviously simple in structure, and nagging away as you watch it is the fact that the ending is never in doubt, it \"is\" all too predictable. However, what made Erin Brockovich the success it was is that the title character is not only interesting but also, importantly, intriguing. A foul mouthed hard bitten, twice divorced mother of three has to fight her corner just to get an honest days pay. It's a fabulous story backed up by a simply incredible performance from Julia Roberts. Here Roberts has let her hair down, puts on a push up bra and a short skirt, she is clearly enjoying the freedom of the role, and the results are real effective.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that working alongside Albert Finney helped Roberts no ends, but it is her show all the way, and she alone masks over what really is an ordinary film, there is nothing we haven't seen before here, it's just a more modern take on the good versus evil corporate company scenario. It's steadily directed by Steven Soderbergh, emotional scenes are not overstretched to treacle point, and all in all it's good solid story telling. Repeat viewings prove to dilute the uplift factor of the finale, but Roberts' performance certainly holds firm for evermore.\r\n\r\n8/10 for the film, 10/10 for Roberts' ballsy show. If only we could have had more of these performances from her."

But pretty soon after the disaster strange accidents start to befall those who got off the plane, it seems that death is out to get them.\r\n\r\nWith the number of hugely disappointing teens in peril movies that were made post the success of Wes Craven's hugely successful Scream, it's refreshing to find one that was, well, refreshing. Not purporting to be anything other than a wickedly entertaining piece of horror based nonsense, Final Destination is inventive, funny and above all else, shock laden.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening, and terrifying air crash sequence to the clever and gross way that our protagonists shake hands with the grim reaper, this film is gloriously proud of its horror intent. One peak at the surnames of the characters will tell you just how into their horror roots the makers are here, whilst not a homage movie as such, James Wong and his team clearly know what makes a modern horror picture work.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself complaining about the writing then you clearly are missing the point of Final Destination's existence, either that or you are in fact dead yourself! Four fun but vastly inferior sequels would follow, but really this is the one to watch, as good a 100 minutes of horror fun as you could wish to have. I dare you not to jump out your seat at least once! 9/10"

John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) make for an outstanding duo in the lead roles, they are truly perfect for their respective roles.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, you have the excellent Steve Buscemi portraying Randall to terrific effect. There are also memorable roles for James Coburn (Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia) and Bob Peterson (Roz). You, of course, also have Boo (Mary Gibbs) who is simply adorable.\r\n\r\nEverything else from the plot to the animation is fantastic, too - I have no faults with this film. Funny, wholesome, entertaining and touching. I see they're creating a television series, <em>'Monsters at Work'</em>, which could be good given it will have the same cast.\r\n\r\nA must-watch!"

At least it's good for something.\r\n\r\nThe second of the Mars based box office bombs released in 2000, Red Planet is maybe - just maybe - worth a revisit by some who were irritated by it back on first viewing. Once knowing that this is not going to be some action packed alien movie, that it's a survivalist drama that tips its hat to 1950s sci-fi schlock, that cares about its characters, then there's a decent popcorner experience to be had here. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say it's a genius entry in the sci-fi pantheon, because it's not, the same problems still exist; Terence Stamp is woefully under used (seriously they could have got any low paid character actor to play his role), some things either don't make sense or are left unanswered, and of course it still drags in the middle as the boys chatter away on Mars whilst Carrie Anne-Moss is up at base station fretting and suffering erectus nippleus.\r\n\r\nYet there's fun to be had here, some nutty science marries up with nice photography and splendid set design, and the makers know what sort of picture they want to make. Where Mission to Mars sunk under the weight of its own pretensions - trying to go all elegiac and important, Red Planet nudges and winks and asks you along for the ride. So get on board and take it for what it is, a pretentious free zone with good human drama at the core. 6.5/10"

When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a bank, Terry recognises the danger but realises this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at a Lloyds Bank, they quickly realise that, besides millions in riches, the boxes also contain secrets that implicate everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Although the heist makes headlines throughout Britain for several days, a government gag order eventually brings all reporting of the case to an immediate halt.",

            "review": "I managed to see this movie on it's first day of screening in New York, back in 2000, just before I went back to Europe.\r\n\r\n'Coyote Ugly' is a nice romantic comedy, perfectly fit for the generation who didn't grow up with 'Flashdance', Saturday Night Fever etc.\r\n\r\nPiper Perado plays the young aspiring song-writer who wants to get a major record-deal, write songs and then safely watch others perform her music. But then there's this little snag, called reality. Although the story is not very surprising it is solid and consistent told. We understand why she ends up on the bar dancing (no spoiler here). And at the same time we understand why her father is disappointed. A fine part played by John Goodman. At times their relationship reminded me of the one Madonna and Danny Aiello had in the 'Father Don't Preach' music-video. Father reluctantly sees his daughter grow up. And she only wants him to be proud of her.\r\n\r\nAfter I saw the trailer on television I immediately went to the REAL Coyote Ugly Saloon on 1st Avenue on which this film was based (unless there's another one, of course). The real bar is not nearly as flashy as it's celluloid counterpart. But they DO hose down annoying customers with beer and there IS dancing on the bar. However by the female customers, rather than the waitresses. But they do get fresh with you if you happen to order something they don't serve. (anything besides beer and Jack Daniels) And they do drink shots with the costumers. Funny detail is that in the movie is explained why they don't get drunk.\r\n\r\nI know, I know, we already have Flashdance. (Also from Bruckheimer) but I don't mind if this type of story is being updated now and then, right? Although the soundtrack could sound a bit more contemporary."

            "review": "Moulin Rouge has many things to like about it, but comes off as inconsistent at times.\r\n\r\nAll of the actors were top notch. I believe it was Nicole Kidman's best performance of her career. Ewan\r\nMcGregor usually doesn't add a lot of depth to his characters, but in this movie it was ample. Jim Broadbent was charismatic and Richard Roxburgh was a very convincing pervert, right down to his posture. I liked how well they developed each of these characters. The rest of the actors were also excellent, but the story didn't lend much depth to their character, and they simply came off as a backdrop or environment for the main four, often becoming a writers convenience or becoming a set of eyes we could see through from the outside looking in.\r\n\r\nThere were so many parts I enjoyed about this movie, more particularly the segments where Kidman and McGregor's relationship was explored. This made for a great second act of the movie. The first and third act I felt suffered from Baz Luhrmann's rapid, almost epileptic, editing style. His style is not not for everyone, but particularly in this movie, it didn't allow for much depth of the movie in the first and third act and came off as flashy and showy. This created pacing issues that I felt if he had slowed down and focused more on the characters instead of fitting as many shots into the move that he could, the story would have flowed a lot better.\r\n\r\nThe other major inconsistency of the movie was the theme it was building towards, and the theme it ultimately landed on. Throughout the entire movie, they are building a theme of faith in love no matter what the outcome, but the last minute and a half of the movie turns it into a tragedy that I felt was unwarranted and unearned. This would have been a palpable ending if the movie showed the characters doubting that maybe love wasn't enough, and then a tragedy strikes that proves the point.  But instead we have the ending segment that shows us that all this guy's belief in love was absolutely for not, and that we are left to assume he must have been faking his belief the entire time, because it sure didn't seem like enough for him. This isn't about always getting a happy ending, it's about not getting an ending that was a cheap and quick way to evoke a particular emotion in the audience without really building into. It felt rushed, and again, unearned. (And I'm not talking about the actual event, but more about how the event affected the character.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. An excellent second act with outstanding performances and likable characters, but with the pacing issues and inconsistencies in building a movie that naturally flowed from one idea to the next keeps me from rating it higher. All in all, though, a fairly enjoyable and rewatch able film nonetheless."

A pretty kid is a ticket to trouble... and I'm too old to ask for that.\r\n\r\nThe prison genre of film has a very chequered history, and the number of films are many, very much so, both good and bad. It has gotten to the stage where in this day and age we yearn and need more from our prison based films, something more substantial away from rape and violence, away from father figures, or of redemption and friendship bonds. Unfortunately Animal Factory relies on all the clich\u00e9s of the genre to tell its tale, which is actually at odds with how good a film it is. Deftly performed by the principal cast members, mounted with a keen eye by director Steve Buscemi, and played with an authentic vibe that lures you in and keeps you hooked, but there is unfortunately nothing remotely new here. However, if you are not over familiar with the prison based arc of cinema? Then this delivers rewards, and such is the quality of production, it doesn't deserve to be marked down. 7/10"

After one of the team suffers an accident, the Toros recruit gymnastics star Missy Pantone, but upon witnessing the Toros first routine Missy is disgusted and points out that it has been stolen from another team called The East Compton Clovers. This opens up a whole can of worms that not only brings the Toros into conflict with the Clovers, but also means that they must come up with an original routine if they are to win the American championship honestly.\r\n\r\nSpirited picture about cheer leading? Well yes it is, it's witty, smart and ever so amiable. Tho the film loses some of its sharpness in the final quarter (a brave ending would have made all the difference), Bring It On clearly touches on race and class issues whilst bringing to the fore the competitiveness of cheerleader teams. The usual formula's of bitching and back stabbing are naturally in here, and of course no film of this type would be complete without some strand of treacle plot love, but the mix is fine and the exuberance of the routines is hugely enjoyable cinema. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union and Jesse Bradford fill out the cast and all offer something in the way of watch ability.\r\n\r\nIt could have been so much better for sure, but Bring It On is very entertaining film about a subject that until this picture came out (subsequent sequels would follow) was hardly tackled with this sort of vigour and intelligence before. 7/10"

In this, it's where the movie systematically makes fun of people from anger management issues, to serious conditions, to amputees, and all of them lonely and possibly desperate, so it's extra sad.\r\n\r\nYes, it's the premise of the movie that he's an unexpected gigolo with unexpected clients, but I'm not sure anyone was asking for this movie.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, this is a alternating abuse humor / ridiculous escalation humor, and a lot of the movie is just Rob being exasperated with his own script.  To top it off, it feels like there is one story line too many with the cop investigating him.  The angry gigolo with WAY too many expensive things that he mistreats is plenty of antagonist.\r\n\r\nThey definitely put the work in on the production side though, even incorporating a couple of matrix references that probably cost far more than warranted for the movie.\r\n\r\nI don't blame you if you do like this movie, but there has got to be something better to watch."

(to give this a more modern reference, I rate this one below \"The Vow\" on the painful to watch scale. If The Vow is a broken femur, Dr. T and the Women is everlasting torment in the 9th circle of Hell.) \r\n\r\nI try to look for the good in any movie, and I have plenty of low budget favorites as well as many Hollywood, blockbuster favorites.  I've actually seen Dr. T. and the Women, movie on people's \"Favorites\" lists and I scratch my head and the only conclusion I can come up with is that the people that made this movie and actually like this movie are infatuated with Richard Gere and he could just stand in front of a camera doing anything at random for 90 minutes and these persons would have a deep admiration of the film...  As a movie there is just nothing here. It is an absolute piece of c. I honestly believe that this movie could cause brain damage. Honestly I generally like Richard Gere movies, be they chick flick or not, but this is just an abomination. And if you absolutely have to see Helen Hunt in a \"B\" movie checkout Trancers. At least there is no pretense."

Clive Owens gives a great performance and a few of the scenes are remarkably memorable and resonant. However, there are very long stretches where the movie simply stagnates and the plot drifts away, especially towards the end. Overall, it's rather melancholy and despite the \"action\" scenes, not especially thrilling. If you like sci-fi movies set in dystopian futures, or are a big Clive Owen fan, you may still find it worth watching despite its flaws.\r\n\r\nAn aside: One of the \"extras\" on the DVD has some heavily accented academic trilling at length about the movie's philosophical meaning. It's entertainingly over-the-top and almost unintelligible: jargon piled into a Dagwood sandwich of contradictory abstractions. Anyway, if you don't watch too much of it, its good for a laugh."

            "review": "In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?\r\n\r\nSnatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!\r\n\r\nSnatch in story terms is concerned with a big diamond that stitches together a number of threads involving the London underworld. Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen. \r\n\r\nAs with \"Lock-Stock\", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.\r\n\r\nSo it's \"Lock-Stock 2\" then! No bad thing if you happen to be a fan of that sort of wide boy malarkey. If you don't like it? Then jog on sunshine. 8/10"

            "review": "We all lie to ourselves to be happy.\r\n\r\nIt's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.\r\n\r\nChristopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!\r\n\r\nThe reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10"

As much as I like Jennifer Lopez as an actor, we start on the end of a movie I'd rather see with Bree Turner, and I feel like I would have rather seen Judy Greer in the lead, she seems about as Italian as Jennifer Lopez.\r\n\r\nI understand when the meet-cute is a life-threatening situation where adrenaline causes chemical confusion, but this is sort of a head injury causes an almost \"love at first sight\" cliche, but mixed with an \"unavailable romance\" cliche.\r\n\r\nOnce we establish that she loves weddings and it's important to her for some reason, it's a lot of him (not) pursuing her because he's getting married, and her trying to be respectful, but honest.\r\n\r\nThe movie highlights more societal problems for people that can afford big weddings, or, in short, there is more dumb than funny in this.\r\n\r\nI'm not even going to say this is a bad movie, but it's not impressive, and just not for me."

But I can tell you to watch it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

            "review": "In Greek mythology, the Titans were greater even than the gods.\r\n\r\nBased on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.\r\n\r\nAs is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.\r\n\r\nThat this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.\r\n\r\nThe cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. While two important female family roles are nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" particularly potent and uplifting. \r\n\r\nThough not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?), so hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10"

The squad is headed by a strong, but morally suspicious leader (Tom Berenger) and his somewhat sinister right-hand man (Dennis Rodman). Maxine Bahns, Ron Silver and Casper Van Dien are also on hand.\r\n\r\n\"Cutaway\" (2000) is a skydiving crime thriller that cost $9 million and debuted on TV in the USA, but straight-to-video elsewhere. It features spectacular skydiving sequences supplemented by stock footage. Airplanes are ubiquitous, but only as means of transport.\r\n\r\nIf you want skydiving action \u201cCutaway\u201d delivers the goods. It helps that Baldwin is a likable protagonist and Berenger has his typical edgy charisma. Bahns doesn\u2019t do much for me on the female front, but she\u2019s a\u2019right. Stunningly statuesque Cat Stone has a bit part. While Van Dien\u2019s role is small, this movie upped my respect for him. He previously struck me as a pretty boy type, but he\u2019s totally kick axx here.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the Miami area, Florida (Miami-Dade County & Opa Locka), and Fort Bragg, NC.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

Thus we have all the comedy that comes with her literally battling everyone, including her own opinions on pageants, as she is being asked to be something she doesn't believe is in her make up. The mystery of who the killer is who's on the loose is strong for a good portion of film, and even once it's known and drama takes centre stage, it's still hard to get the smile off of your face. \r\n\r\nThe jokes are plentiful, with Bullock finding chemistry with all of her co-stars. She's a very under valued comedy actress, and her ability to bond with an entire cast is marvellous to observe. Reference sexual tension with Benjamin Bratt, the jousting hostilities with Ernie Hudson, the way she bounces off of the other beautiful girls, and best of all the by-play with Michael Caine, who is playing a camp stylist and walks in to lift the laughter roof off the rafters in every scene he is in.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but it's thankfully a consistently funny piece of work, aided by a super cast on form who make a better comedy out of what the screenplay suggested it had any right to be. 7/10"

Having read the books before I watched the movies, that actually does sort of track, as the first two books were better than the third. Even so, I actually think _Hannibal_ does the worst job of adapting the source material too. Looks pretty good and there's quite the cast list (although I don't think many of them are exactly giving career-defining performances here), Julianne Moore is fine as Clarice Starling (although not as good as Jodie Foster), and the story isn't **bad**, but if I'm being honest, I typically give this one a skip whenever I'm revisiting the Lecter mythos. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

A splendid \"support cast\" are wasted as Michael Bay and his production team think they can produce some sort of Titanic of the Skies like epic and fail in their objective. By the time of the brilliantly constructed assault by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, and \"it is\" exhilarating and edge of the seat heart pounding, you are left with the feeling that all the main characters in the piece are not really worth our emotional investment.\r\n\r\nIt's not an outright stinker, situations such as the nurses trying to cope in the hospital during the attack are poignant, and there's a jingoistic - cum - romantic fervour that screams out that the film wants to be genuine in making you feel, well, emotionally battered. However, given the budget and time you are asked to invest in the story, it's impossible not to feel cheated as the clock ticks past the three hour mark.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's unfair to use Titanic as a template for this type of epic? Especially since over the course of time many have come out of the woodwork to knock Titanic when previously there were nods in appreciation for it, all be it grudgingly. But Pearl Harbor just doesn't have enough about it to make it even a \"time waster\" recommendation, and this even allowing for some quality \"Bayhem\" action as the film rolls into its blunderbuss third quarter. 5/10"

            "review": "***War of the rats in crumbling Stalingrad during WWII***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2001 and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, \"Enemy at the Gates\" takes place in the last four months of 1942 during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated, Major K\u00f6nig (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.\r\n\r\nMost WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas \"Enemy\" is one of only two mainline films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated \"Cross of Iron\" (1977).\r\n\r\nThree things stuck in my mind after seeing \u201cEnemy at the Gates\u201d years ago: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga to join the fight is extremely harrowing, not far removed from the opening D-Day invasion in \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d (1998), but different. \u201cEnemy\u201d is worth viewing for this sequence alone. (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurrying-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet lovemaking scene while the soldiers lain in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real: Men & women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the book \"War of the Rats\" by David L. Robbins and thus intentionally provokes the imagery of human rats scurrying through the debris. The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.\r\n\r\nAs with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. \"The zippers on the trousers aren't right, blasphemy!!\"), but \"Enemy\" gets the gist correct and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad. What more can you ask for? \r\n\r\nThe fact is Vassili had 260 verified Nazi kills and played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare (with roughly 2 million killed, wounded or captured). The movie effectively shows how the Russian combatants weren't necessarily professionally trained soldiers; many of them were peasants, workers, teachers, mailmen, farmers, etc. They knew they could die the next morning hence they celebrated (and made love) while they could. Stalingrad was one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.\r\n\r\nFINAL WORD: \"Enemy at the Gates\" details an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has several memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot entirely in Germany (Brandenburg and Bavaria).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

Yet viewing it now on its own chaotic sci-fi terms, it's a surprisingly brisk and enjoyable picture.\r\n\r\nDirected by Roger Spottiswoode, it's a futuristic collage of outrageous set-pieces and thought provoking thematics. Plot has Arnie as an ex-fighter pilot who discovers he has been illegally cloned, and thus he embarks on a mission of carnage and high paced machismo in a bid to get his identity back whilst exposing the evil corporation at the core of such nastiness. So, two Arnie's for the price of one then!\r\n\r\nIt's not a plot that would hold up under close scrutiny, but then is that what we go into a Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie for? Quite. With some nifty surprises, kinetic action and an ending of some considerable chilling substance, The 6th Day is classic popcorn munching fodder. No it's not in the top tier of Arnie movies, and no it's hardly shaking the foundations of sci-fi cinema, but sometimes comfort food sci-fi has its own rewards for an undemanding occasion. 6.5/10"

True that Unbreakable, with its deliberate slow pacing and left-field narrative, would (and has) proved to be not everyone's cup-o-tea, but there's a film making craft here, and a genius idea brought to vivid life, that makes a spectrum of film lovers lament how his career nose dived, how his ideas quickly got as stupid as his acting...\r\n\r\nUnbreakable challenges the thought process, spinning a story that's of a adult comic book heart, but also of a clinical human examination. The narrative is consistently ambiguous, holding the patient viewers in enthral as the cosmic conundrums come tumbling off of the screen. It's refreshing to find a story like this that is so devoid of clich\u00e9, where the wonderfully reflective Bruce Willis and the brilliantly fascinating Samuel L. Jackson feed off each other, their character's destinies superbly steered by cast and director. Unbreakable is a complex movie, but not needlessly so, its strengths are numerous for those of a keen eye and ear. It represents Shyamalan's most clever cinematic offering, to which the sad realisation comes to pass that he would never, as yet, be this smart and vibrant again. 10/10"

It has the tone & setting of \u201cUrban Legend\u201d (1998), but without the slasher aspect. It\u2019s also reminiscent in some ways of \u201cAn American Werewolf in Paris\u201d (1997), albeit obviously omitting the lycanthropes.\r\n\r\nThe production values are top-notch for the genre and era, but I found Melissa Sagemiller uninteresting as the protagonist. However, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Eliza (No Booty) Dushku and Angela Featherstone are all interesting. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that the story isn\u2019t compelling enough, although the climax is revelatory and moving. Speaking of which, the movie\u2019s a mystery concerning life & death issues. It brings to mind a cult film from the early 60s, but I can\u2019t say its name because I don\u2019t want to give anything away. While \u201cSoul Survivors\u201d recalls that flick, it\u2019s different enough to stand on its own. So even if you go in knowing it shares plot elements with that particular film it won\u2019t ruin your viewing experience.    \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in the Chicago area, including Evanston and the corresponding Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

I wasn't expecting to enjoy <em>'The Kid'</em> as much as I did.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis and Spencer Breslin team up to solid effect, in a film that produces amusement and wholesomeness. I find the premise very interesting, it's a cool concept. While they might not executed to 100% perfection, what's given is entertaining to see unfold. There are some very sweet scenes, also.\r\n\r\nWillis is, as you'd expect, the best part of this, but I think Breslin does a grand job too. The latter tended to do these sorta roles a lot, but there's a reason for that as he played them convincingly. Emily Mortimer (Amy) is also satisfactory in this, while there's a minor appearance from a younger Melissa McCarthy.\r\n\r\nVery good, unexpectedly."

            "review": "**The world can't change by itself, we must bring it.**\r\n\r\nAfter watching this film I just remembered the quote from 'Sullivan's Travels' which says 'film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known'. Indeed, cinema's for entertainment as well acts as a message deliverer. This was an inspirational movie, and everybody must see it. I know I'm a bit late to see it, better late than never, right? I'm really glad for having it at the right time because 15 years ago I did not have this blog to write about it.\r\n\r\nOK, the name of the movie represents the theme of the story. No matter its a developed or developing country, society needs something like the idea this movie talks about. Carrying a good social message, the movie slightly lags behind the too much on the emotions, especially the end part. There won't be a problem if you like melodrama. Other than that, I feel the conclusion was smart and strong, a better solution which would appeal for certain group rather alternate finale.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the novel of the same name, crafted by a fine director with the wonderful cast. Haley Joel Osment had a great career as a child-star, you should check some of his films if you love children's movies including this title on the top of that list. As a middle aged actor, Helen Hunt's one of the last best performances before turning into a senior artist. It's not a usual role for Kevin Spacey, but he nailed it with the good dialogues. Especially his talk about the topic 'child abuse' was a great thing from the movie. Overall, the actors get more credit for the first- class acts as the script demanded for their respective roles.\r\n\r\n> What did you ever do to change the world. \r\n\r\nA movie about a man who achieved in science gets the Oscar, not that real man. A movie about a man escapes from the war prison camp and slavery gets the award, and again none of those real persons. But a movie with the original, intelligent, inspiring, specially designed for a movie was not even a contender of the Oscars. Of course, it was transformed from a book, though there are/were no real people behind these great characters, all are imagined/created for the book and the movie. I never understood the American Academy Awards.\r\n\r\nBy now you would know that I hate critics badly if you are a regular reader of my blog. Once again they failed to recognise how great the morality of the story is, rather they have concentrated to criticise the writing and the technical aspect of the film. Although, it was not a box office flop or earned beyond, but got a lot of praise from the families. It's a wonderful family drama, but still too far from being a masterpiece. Intelligent enough one to get motivated towards the social issues. Being practical in the real world is a concern as it is risky, depending on the situation and the person, just like this movie's ending. Rare to find a movie like this, you must check it out.\r\n\r\n8/10"

Maybe parents will get a kick out of seeing this and imagining their kids....but given the amount of sibling infighting, probably not.\r\n\r\nAlan Cumming absolutely steals the show with his Willy Wonka impersonation, and I'm furious that he didn't get the role over Depp when they did the reboot.\r\n\r\nThe casts is odd, but does a great performance, and the kids having to fight themselves really did a great job.\r\n\r\nIt's probably still has good than bad, but just can't say you should watch this right now with all the options out there."

It is very good. My favourite part of it is the animation which is exquisite, especially across acts one and two with the great amount of detail. The characters are cool, while the premise is pretty fascinating.\r\n\r\nMichael J. Fox is a superb cast as Milo, he is fantastic in the lead role. Honestly, none of the other voices stand out to me but that's not always a bad thing - especially in this film. There are no huge individual performances, away from Fox, but they all bounce off each other nicely.\r\n\r\nThe plot is very interesting, brought to life brilliantly by James Newton Howard's terrific score. It's not near the top of my Disney animated favourites, just through process of elimination really, but it certainly isn't majorly far off. It's a fun experience, one I'd recommend you see for yourself if you haven't done so already."

The movie finds a nice balance between being based on religion and being (not sac-)religious.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that while it is solid, it doesn't necessarily hold up to 2020 comdies."

After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there\u2019s a one-dimensional pale \u2018look\u2019 to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.\r\n\r\nEverything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.               \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

There's something amiss in the world of movies and art, and Dundee is soon to be right in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nUndeniably the worst of the three Crocodile Dundee movies, to the point where you wonder just why anyone at the studio gave it the green light? By the time Crocodile Dundee II came out in 1988, it was obvious that much of the charm and adventure like magic from the first film had greatly diminished. So fast forward 13 years and they saw fit to produce another movie.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough it turns out to not be a complete stinker, yes the formula is tired, I mean how many times can you do the fish out of water comedy before it gets lame? But there's some genuinely funny sequences in here, with barbed asides towards the movie industry and the American way of life. Hogan and Kozlowski are still likable leads, their chemistry cemented, and if you can get past the stereotypes on show (they forgot this was not the 80s!) there's some fun to be had on a time waster basis.\r\n\r\nInstantly forgettable, and certainly not needed, it is however a pic that fans of the first two films can find a modicum of comfort in. 5.5/10"

Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom\u2019s babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of \u201cThe Warriors\u201d (1979) and \u201cTorque\u201d (2004) with the more serious air of \u201cGrand Canyon\u201d (1991) and \u201cTraining Day\u201d (2001). (Yes, I realize \u201cTorque\u201d and \u201cTraining Day\u201d debuted after this one; I\u2019m just providing comparative references). \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the tone, there\u2019s no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.\r\n\r\nBrewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent \u201cDeep Enough\u201d by Live.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

As with all action films, especially those that feature one of the action heroes we grew up with, there will be supporters of even the most turgid of productions. Collateral Damage was the point where the truest and honest of Arnold Schwarzenegger's fans knew it was the end of an era. \r\n\r\nFamously held back from release for a year due to the 9/11 attacks on the twin towers, the film pitches Schwarzenegger as a L.A. fireman, who after his wife and child are killed by an act of terrorism, decides to take the law into his own hands. The focus here is Colombia, and the big guy goes off to Colombia on a one man crusade to kill those responsible for his grief. Cue explosions, kinetic action, bad effects, bad dialogue, mucho posturing and hissing villains.\r\n\r\nIt works on a very basic level for fans of such fare, in fact it's nice to see Arnie playing a vulnerable role where he quite often gets hurt - both physically and mentally. It's just that it feels tired, feels too long, while it wastes a cast that includes Elias Koteas, John Turturo and John Leguizamo. Decent enough as a time waster? Yes, just, but really if this wasn't on Schwarzenegger's CV then nobody would lose any sleep over it. 5/10"

Morpheus in particular unreels extended speeches that remind me of Laurence Olivier's remarks when he won his honorary Oscar--the speech that had Jon Voight going \"God!\" on TV, but in print turned out to be quasi-Shakespearean doublespeak. The speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: It sure sounds like those guys are saying some profound things.\r\n\r\nThat will not prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of \"The Matrix Reloaded\" in endless Web postings. Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology; there is something refreshingly ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass culture, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.\r\n\r\nI say this not in disapproval, but in amusement. \"The Matrix\" (1999), written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much inflamed pseudo-philosophy that it's all \"The Matrix Reloaded\" can do to stay ahead of its followers. It is an immensely skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: heroes and villains, special effects and stunts, chases and explosions, romance and oratory. It develops its world with more detail than the first movie was able to afford, gives us our first glimpse of the underground human city of Zion, burrows closer to the heart of the secret of the Matrix, and promotes its hero, Neo, from confused draftee to a Christ figure in training.\r\n\r\nAs we learned in \"The Matrix,\" the Machines need human bodies, millions and millions of them, for their ability to generate electricity. In an astonishing sequence, we saw countless bodies locked in pods around central cores that extended out of sight above and below. The Matrix is the virtual reality that provides the minds of these sleepers with the illusion that they are active and productive. Questions arise, such as, is there no more efficient way to generate power? And why give the humans dreams when they would generate just as much energy if comatose? And why create such a complex virtual world for each and every one of them, when they could all be given the same illusion and be none the wiser? Why is each dreamer himself or herself, occupying the same body in virtual reality as the one asleep in the pod? But never mind. We are grateful that 250,000 humans have escaped from the grid of the Matrix, and gathered to build Zion, which is \"near the Earth's core--where there is more heat.\" As the movie opens, we are alarmed to learn that the Machines are drilling toward Zion so quickly that they will arrive in 36 hours. We may also wonder if Zion and its free citizens really exist, or if the humans only think so, but that leads to a logical loop ending in madness.\r\n\r\nNeo (Keanu Reeves) has been required to fly, to master martial arts, and to learn that his faith and belief can make things happen. His fights all take place within virtual reality spaces, while he reclines in a chair and is linked to the cyberworld, but he can really be killed, because if the mind thinks it is dead, \"the body is controlled by the mind.\" All of the fight sequences, therefore, are logically contests not between physical bodies, but between video game-players, and the Neo in the big fight scenes is actually his avatar.\r\n\r\nThe visionary Morpheus, inspired by the prophecies of the Oracle, instructed Neo--who gained the confidence to leap great distances, to fly and in \"Reloaded\" destroys dozens of clones of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in martial combat. That fight scene is made with the wonders of digital effects and the choreography of the Hong Kong action director Yuen Wo Ping, who also did the fights in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\" It provides one of the three great set pieces in the movie.\r\n\r\nThe second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses the assembled multitude--an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in \"Metropolis.\" After his speech, the citizens dance in a percussion-driven frenzy, which is intercut with Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) having sex. I think their real bodies are having the sex, although you can never be sure.\r\n\r\nThe third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with gloriously choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. That this scene logically takes place in cyberspace does not diminish its thrilling 14-minute fun ride, although we might wonder--when deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it? (I am sure I will get untold thousands of e-mails explaining it all to me.) I became aware, during the film, that a majority of the major characters were played by African Americans. Neo and Trinity are white, and so is Agent Smith, but consider Morpheus; his superior Commander Lock (Harry Lennix); the beautiful and deadly Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), who once loved Morpheus and now is with Lock, although she explains enigmatically that some things never change; the programmer Link (Harold Perrineau); Link's wife, Zee (Nona Gaye), who has the obligatory scene where she complains he's away from home too much, and the Oracle (the late Gloria Foster, very portentous). From what we can see of the extras, the population of Zion is largely black.\r\n\r\nIt has become commonplace for science fiction epics to feature one or two African-American stars, but we've come a long way since Billy Dee Williams in \"Return of the Jedi.\" The Wachowski brothers use so many African Americans, I suspect, not for their box-office appeal, because the Matrix is the star of the movie, and not because they are good actors (which they are), but because to the white teenagers who are the primary audience for this movie, African-Americans embody a cool, a cachet, an authenticy. Morpheus is the power center of the movie, and Neo's role is essentially to study under him and absorb his mojo.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with \"To Be Concluded,\" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. Toward the end, there are scenes involving characters who seem pregnant with possibilities for Part 3. One is the Architect (Helmut Bakaltis), who says he designed the Matrix and revises everything Neo thinks he knows about it. Is the Architect a human, or an avatar of the Machines? The thing is, you can never know for sure. He seems to hint that when you strip away one level of false virtual reality, you find another level beneath. Maybe everything so far is several levels up? Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time tells the story of a cosmologist whose speech is interrupted by a little old lady who informs him that the universe rests on the back of a turtle. \"Ah, yes, madame,\" the scientist replies, \"but what does the turtle rest on?\" The old lady shoots back: \"You can't trick me, young man. It's nothing but turtles, turtles, turtles, all the way down.\"\r\n\r\n3.5/4\r\n\r\n- Roger Ebert"

            "review": "My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player.\r\n\r\nThe Salton Sea is directed by D. J. Caruso and written by Tony Gayton. It stars Val Kilmer, Vincent D'Onofrio, Peter Sarsgard, Doug Hutchinson, Anthony LaPaglia, Debora Kara Unger, Adam Goldberg and Luis Guzm\u00e1n. Music is scored by Thomas Newman and cinematography by Amir Mokri.\r\n\r\nDanny Parker (Kilmer) is hanging out with a bunch of methamphetamine users, apparently in an effort to numb the pain of his one time life that saw his wife murdered. Or is he? The word of mouth for it was strong, but no sooner did it hit cinemas than it disappeared off the face of the earth. However, the cult cinema world is often a vibrant place to lurk, enter there and you find The Salton Sea, a wonderfully tricksy and off beat neo-noir awash with misery, revenge, redemption and odd ball characters that are either stuck in purgatory, or heading to nowhereville.\r\n\r\nProtagonist Danny Parker leads the film, a man whose identity is fractured after being dealt a blow from the hands of fate, very much in limbo mentally, he none the less has goals to achieve, nothing is never quite as it seems until director Caruso wants us in on the side-shifts. Danny is often in the company of danger and weird characters, from a hopped up harpoon wielding loon, to a no nose psycho (too much meth up the nose will make you lose it kids), via dirty cops and meth heads, it's a world of unease, the twisty plot drawing the viewer in with a kinky smile on its face.\r\n\r\nCaruso also pulls off the neat trick of placing humour in this off kilter world without hurting the dramatic harshness of the thematics. There's a quite brilliant sequence that shows a botched crime being attempted by the meth head crew, this we watch at the same time as they discuss about actually pulling the crime off. That it involves a stool sample from Bob Hope should tell you all you need to know about the intelligence of the wannabe perps! Caruso's camera is fluid and he uses certain neo-noir visual tricks of the trade as well (time lapses etc), and he also has a knack for varying the mood without averting the slowly bubbling to the surface pace that the story requires.\r\n\r\nKilmer is superb, perfectly low-key, there is no need for rage, the yearning for revenge and redemption, for identity, is brought out via calmly delivered dialect, and it's very affecting. D'Onofrio as Pooh Bear, the afore mentioned no nose fella, steals the movie with another of his off the planet nut-jobs. Elsewhere, Sarsgard is as appealing as he has ever been as Danny's stoner best mate, Hutchinson and LaPaglia cut fine figures as dirty cops, while Guzm\u00e1n and Danny Trejo leave an impressively grungy mark. The only disappointment is the lack of screen time for Kara Unger, a fine actress, she is playing what turns out to be a critical femme fatale role, but really we needed more of her. It's a rare misstep in an otherwise cracking neo-noir that is highly recommended to fans of similarly devilishly fun pictures. 8.5/10"

There he pledges to the mother that he will find her daughter's killer.\r\n\r\nD\u00fcrrenmatt's source material has been mined a few times for other filmic ventures, where the best of the other bunch is \"Es geschah am hellichten Tag\" (\"It Happened in Broad Daylight\"). It is here, though, in Sean Penn's hands, that we get the version that got two thumbs up from the author, mostly because of the ending staying true to his work.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted from the off that this is not police procedural detective piece. This is a slow burn, moody and edgy picture, the kind that Penn excells at as an actor. Thankfully, in spite of it losing money at the box office, it shows Penn the perfect director for such material.\r\n\r\nIt obviously isn't a film for everyone, more so if not prepared for it being a picture about one man's tumbling emotional descent. As Jerry Black searches for the perpretrator of heinious crimes, he also is faced with a moral judgement call and a major affair of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe trick of the screnplay here is not in the red herrings and the little dangles of clues that appear to be on offer to Jerry, it's that we are never quite sure if Jerry is actually right in his belief of a child serial killer at work. Is it the product of a man so driven by the pledge he made, that he isn't thinking straight? Or worse losing his grip on sanity? The answer will only will out with the clinically daring finale. \r\n\r\nLead actors Nicholson and Wright Penn turn in some of their finest work, both responding to Sean's probing of troubled souls in search of an exit. There's an array of quality support actors in small parts, which is a testament to the pull that working with Penn did appeal. The musical score is nervy and sits smartly with the ethereal tones that Menges brings via his photographic lenses.\r\n\r\nThe Pledge is a haunting and disturbing character study that refuses to cop out. It achieves its aims and wasn't going to pander to any crowd pleasing bums on seats tactics. A dark thriller for grown ups who have the patience for such a telling, and perhaps more crucially are prepared to have their emotions tested with the finale. 9/10"

They want to listen to music, experience their senses by seeing artwork, read books or having pets.\r\n\r\nThese people are exterminated by clerics, an elite hit squad. Christian Bale is the best of the clerics but once he stops taking his medicine, he feels for the first time and gets into contact with a resistance group to overthrow the leader.\r\n\r\nFilmed in Berlin, Equilibrium comes across like an updated version of Fahrenheit 451 but feels too much like a knockoff of The Matrix with a rather a sterile narrative at the beginning which made it rather uninvolving.\r\n\r\nBale's behaviour is so odd once he stops taking the drugs, he should just had been caught and shot."

It makes sense that these actors would band together to do a comedic project, but I can't imagine why they did an \"idiot boys club\" trope with a \"gay as comedy\" twist.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of Amanda Peet (but do watch \"A Lot Like Love\" and \"Brockmire\", oddly both baseball subjects), but she is the best actor in this by about a factor of 10.  She plays a highly intellectual character that just doesn't fit in the same world as these other characters (most likely by design), and even manages to do some action sequences with other people involved without them also doing the action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhile I like Jason Biggs, Amanda Detmer, and R. Lee Ermey, I'm not a Steve Zahn fan, and this is not Jack Black's best work.  Being as the majority of the movie is the latter and Amanda Peet, there is a lot of \"this is kind of annoying\" as opposed to \"this is kind of funny\".\r\n\r\nThe structural writing is actually good, but the premise and the comedic writing is ludicrous, and it is pretty hit or miss.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend it just because there are too many other options: just the number of abuse humor comedies starring Jason Biggs is enough to give you a list of suggestions for other movies."

Mason, a greenhorn British regiment in 1884 is commissioned to Egyptian-ruled Sudan to fight Mahdi rebels. A young officer, Harry (Heath Ledger), unexpectedly resigns and is shamed as a coward by his three best friends (e.g. Wes Bentley) and fianc\u00e9e (Kate Hudson). After the negative fallout he goes to Sudan undercover to hopefully redeem his honor.\r\n\r\n\"The Four Feathers\" (2002) is similar to Victorian-Brits-fighting-in-Africa flicks like \u201cZulu\u201d (1964) and \u201cKhartoum\u201d (1966), but I prefer this one as it\u2019s just more compelling and is a quality modern production (I\u2019ve never seen the old-fashioned 1939 version).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of gems to mine here, like Harry\u2019s individualism in the face of great social pressure to conform. His reasoning is simple: He never wanted to be a soldier and only took the commission to please his gung-ho militarist father. Besides, how is what\u2019s happening in the Sudanese desert relevant to him and the British in the first place? Why should he risk dying or losing a limb for this dubious purpose? One of the best parts is Harry\u2019s growing friendship with Sudanian Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the movie\u2019s hampered by two problems: The mechanics of the plot sometimes drive the characters and it doesn\u2019t feel natural or real. For instance, when Harry easily joins the Mahdi rebels and is later seen riding toward the British regiment it\u2019s serious \u201cYeah, right\u201d territory. Another problem is that, from the main battle forward the movie doesn\u2019t allow itself to breath and seems like it\u2019s in a rush, like it doesn\u2019t have the confidence to slow down and tell the story because it\u2019s worried about fitting into a 2-hour timeframe and pleasing those with ADHD.\r\n\r\nIf you can get past those two hitches, this is a worthy historical adventure flick.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in England and Morocco.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"

The plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.\r\n\r\nThe original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film, more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put a case up for the cast of Soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? But really at the time of release it was a stretch to put George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin.\r\n\r\nThe most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.\r\n\r\nThe film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even Don Cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. Some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! What the hell do they want? So the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a Vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using AK 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic Shaobo Qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. All the cast (too many to mention) are great, from Andy Garcia's suave and mean boss, Terry Benedict, to Julia Roberts' (walking like a goddess) Tess Ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9/10"

But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.\r\n\r\nThe characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious \"who done it\" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.\r\n\r\nOwls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10"

            "review": "And so the much-hyped Year Of The Matrix comes to an end. Truthfully, though, the real Year Of The Matrix was 1999, when the groundbreaking original proved to be the right film in the right place at the right time. Tapping into the cultural zeitgeist and Y2K fears about the power of machines over mankind, The Matrix not only revitalized slo-mo action sequences with its 'bullet-time' style, it had a political relevance that already seems dated in a 21st century world dominated by a war against terror, not technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Matrix Reloaded, for all its faults, did try to up the ante, both in its creation of a wider Matrix myth and its budget-heavy effects. Revolutions, however, is content to follow in its wake, the final couple of hours of a four-and-a-half hour slab to which the original movie, in the makers' minds, is but a pre-title sequence. Granted, there's less philosophical babble and more emphasis on action in Revolutions, but the Wachowskis, having backed themselves into pseud's corner, can only deliver with a formula where spectacle and pretentiousness follow on from each other in steady succession. Gut thrills and intellectual stimulation are never integrated as one.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolutions' sustained action set-piece - the Sentinels' attack on Zion - is undeniably exciting, but it sure doesn't feel like an episode from a close sequel to the original Matrix. For a start, Zion was off-screen for the entire first movie. Secondly - and dramatically more importantly - this centerpiece relegates the main characters to, at best, mere bystanders. Neo and Trinity are off on a mission of their own. Morpheus - now dressed in what looks like a burgundy Benetton jumper rather an outfit consistent with his standing as the coolest dude on (or under) the planet - takes a literal backseat to Niobe's driving. Instead, the key players are the Kid, whose backstory is apparent only to those dedicated enough to watch The Animatrix cartoons, and Mifune, whose on-screen impact is unfortunately as brief as it is memorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat such a primary scene is completely filled with secondary characters isn't just disappointing - it's damaging, because it draws attention away from the protagonists' climactic acts. Basically, this is the bit you remember, more than Neo's vital conversation with the Wizard Of Oz-like face of the machines or his up-in-the-air fisticuffs with Smith (a fight whose sfx impact has dwindled following Reloaded's Burly Brawl).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome viewers will indeed be completely satisfied, their questions answered, as the final credits roll, but they're the ones who have done their homework. Without filling in plot gaps by watching The Animatrix or playing derided computer game Enter The Matrix, a sense of confusion reigns. And those who are confused can't emotionally engage with the characters, thus rendering any amount of sacrifices and love themes null and void. In the original film, the casual viewer could relate to a slave race of pod people and their need to be freed, but the Wachowskis seem to have moved the goalposts as the story has progressed, sidelining what began as a focal point of the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, few box-office-storming blockbusters have been aimed so consciously at such a narrow and precise cult audience. The Year Of The Matrix will be remembered as an indulgence for fans, while the original movie will be affectionately held as a separate entity by a bigger crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - What once represented the future of science fiction cinema has become little more than a solid genre offering. But, hey, it wasn't supposed to be the Second Coming, was it? Oh, hang on...\r\n\r\n3/5\r\n\r\n- Empire Magazine"

But avoid the sequels like a bad Christmas sweater\r\n\r\nI think you need to like romantic comedies to enjoy this movie, and that eliminates a lot of guys who tolerate Rom-Coms for the sake of their ladies. And I wonder if they hadn't chosen the actors and actresses for the dozen or so lead and supporting roles so well, this film would have been more of a stinker. But they procured a fine ensemble cast and that keeps the smell down to a bare minimum. \r\n\r\nThere are awkward, cringe-worthy moments that don't make me giggle as they are supposed to - too much gray in my hair, perhaps? (And there isn't that much really!) But despite those awkward lines, to paraphrase a line in the movie, I like it just the way it is. And I think it should have been kept just the way it was. I am now referring to the sequels. Don't get me started, please. The follow-up turned into what just referred to, what the original film could have been like if they hadn't kept their eye on the proverbial ball. As for the second sequel, I just found out today that it exists and I will keep my distance. Stick to the original, I say, and let the rest of the franchise float unbidden out there, just beyond the corner of your eye."

There's lashings of cool on show, some sexiness, and the prime action sequences are exciting. Yet it just comes off as soulless, something emphasised by the awful score and soundtrack.\r\n\r\nActing is OK, particularly from Timothy Dalton as Allan Pinkerton, the man tasked with bringing down Colin Farrell's Jesse James - this whilst having a grudging respect for the outlaw - while Gabriel Macht puts some assured calmness into the role of Frank James. Elsewhere everyone else is having fun even though they be hamstrung by the script.\r\n\r\nThere's hints of thought, such as the power of celebrity status and corporate greed, but these are few and far between, for this is what it is, an action film that works on that level only. 5/10"

It's as if the passions from their road trip to Heaven's Mouth burned too brightly to be sustained once they returned to their normal lives. I first looked at this film as a coming-of-age film, albeit one that happened to include sex scenes much more graphic than others of its genre. That opinion helps me find a reflective starting point for this film, but every time I watch it, I think more and more about the socioeconomic points Cuar\u00f3n interjects throughout. I think more about how little I know about other countries, especially the one just south of my own. (I suppose Tenoch and Julio don't know that much either.) After this last viewing, I thought more about whether the the two actually learned something positive from the experience. We're told they never meet again after the film ends. What happens next? And how does this trip I witnessed mean to that answer?"

Still, some interesting elements, the ghosts' designs, when you can appreciate them, have an almost Hellraiser-like quality to them, and never a bad thing having Tony Shalhoub in the lead even when I didn't once buy into the family dynamic.\r\n\r\nHas the hallmarks of a a film from that era, with the direction (and camera angles) plus the inclusions of Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie franchise) and Matthew Lillard (Scream franchise) in there. Also, the twist at the end didn't make a lick of sense. That said, can't say I was ever bored and honestly, if anyone actually remembered this movie, the setting would make for a fun scare house (and using special glasses to see the entities) somewhere like at the Universal Horror Nights or w/e it's called.\r\n\r\n**2.75/5**"

The script is poor, with much of the dialogue of the tripe delivery kind, and in truth Yun-Fat is wasted in a thankless role. Story throws in a Nazi baddie, a girl on girl scrap and Sean William Scott casting off his petty crime ways to become the way of the samurai \u2013 or something like that.\r\n\r\nBrainless but fun, but also instantly forgettable into the bargain. 5/10"

            "review": "Fantastic story given a quite smashing adaptation.  \r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, when Hollywood is stuck for new swashbuckling ideas, they turn to the writer of \"The Three Musketeers\", \"The Man In The Iron Mask\" and \"The Count Of Monte Cristo\", one Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re. Which of course is no bad thing as long as the adaptation is given care and consideration - which hasn't always been the case. So when it was announced that the director of Waterworld, Kevin Reynolds, was to direct the latest version of \"The Count Of Monte Cristo\", many feared the worst. Made for around $35 million, Reynolds' film fared OK at the Worldwide box office, taking in around $76 million. Yet although far from being a flop, it upped and vanished rather quickly and was barely given a mention come the arrival of 2003. Thankfully the film gathered momentum with the rental releases and is now firmly established as a much loved genre piece.\r\n\r\nOn the two big hitting movie internet sites, Rotten Tomatoes & IMDb, the film scores 75% and 7.5 respectively, that's about right I would say. Reynolds' film doesn't bring anything new to the table as regards the story, but if it isn't broke then why fix it? Staying safe and true to the spirit of the source, Reynolds has simply crafted a rip roaring movie about betrayal, torture, faith, revenge and love. The makers have costumed it up and added the necessary sword play ingredient. All that was needed was for his cast to deliver performances worthy of such period shenanigans. And he got them.\r\n\r\nJames Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes. Two years away from playing Jesus Christ, the role that would make his name known, Caviezel had prior to Cristo looked anything but a leading man. But here he finds a role to get his teeth into and it's a comfortable fit, and crucially he seems to be having a good time with it. No such point to prove for Guy Pearce (Fernand Mondego) though, for he already had \"L.A. Confidential\" & \"Memento\" under his belt. Here he gives it the full pompous villain act and struts around like some dandy spoiled brat. It's a film stealing performance that shows that the guy who played Mike Young in Aussie soaper Neighbours, has indeed come a long way. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Abb\u00e9 Faria, gravel voiced Michael Wincott does a nice line in sadistic bastard as the Ch\u00e2teau D'If governor, Armand Dorleac. While Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Jacopo is fun comic relief and Dagmara Dominczyk as Merced\u00e8s Iguanada is both sensual and heartfelt.\r\n\r\nNever over camping the movie, Reynolds keeps it pacey and dots it with smart set pieces and memorable scenes. Backed up by an on form cast and a sure fire source story to work from, \"The Count Of Monte Cristo\" turns out to be period winner. So see it if you haven't done so already. 8/10"

Still I wish it wasn't Brosnan's last one--and though Craig was truly a refreshing change in his realistic tone that hearkened back to the great days of Connery, that too got old, even for the actor himself."

Jamie Lee Pressly is basically reduced to a male fantasy gag.  I actually like Jake Busey (\"The Frighteners\", I'm unsure exactly why), but his character is specifically unlikeable in this, and barely funny with a one-note joke of being a misogynistic asshole.\r\n\r\nWhile the has some funny moments, there isn't a lot to this movie other than a lesson against gambling and treating women like consumables."

Making up a country for this also feels like a special sub-trope.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm sure is a trope is the \"She's All That\" where you have a clumsy, homely girl that you turn into a beautiful, graceful desirable.\r\n\r\nThe fun of cultures clashing between America and \"Genovia\" is fun, and a family reuniting is touching, but all the high school girl drama, all the flavors, is overdone and boring.  I understand it is needed to develop Mia as a character with which we empathize, but there have to be better ways to establish a character.  Unfortunately, we would lose quite a lot by speeding it up, so I get it.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie doesn't do much special, it's equally good from start to finish, and reliably so."

Well throw all that out the window 'cause I absolutely fuckin' **love** _Super Troopers_. Seriously there is no reason for it, I just do. It's one of about 5 movies where, the second it finishes playing, I could just go back to the start and happily run through it all over again. In fact, I've spent a not-insignificant amount of my lifespan doing exactly that.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"

She vows (against all logic) to build a new palace for Caesar within three months. Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.",
