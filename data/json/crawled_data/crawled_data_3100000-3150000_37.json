            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, especially when it involves alien invasions of some kind, movies like this always leave me excited. It doesn\u2019t matter what the audience or critics have been saying (in fact, it never does) because it won\u2019t affect my enthusiasm (in fact, nothing does). By knowing who the cast, director, writers, and producers are, I instantly know how high or low I need to set my expectations. Having this in mind, I was hoping that Captive State could be one of 2019\u2019s surprises. It has an unusual concept that can provide a very unique story if it\u2019s well-told, so the big question is: did they execute all of their ideas successfully?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no. Not even close. Honestly, the screenplay is so convoluted and messy that I felt \u201clost\u201d several times. I admire the amount of work that they put into this because they actually did and it shows. The overall concept and its ramifications are all there, the story is indeed interesting. It\u2019s just the way that it\u2019s told that ruins the entire thing. However, the first sentence I heard after the film\u2019s conclusion, came from someone who said: \u201chere I was expecting massive action and \u2026\u201d If you go into your movie theater expecting a straightforward, action-heavy, alien-invasion-type flick and you leave disappointed, that\u2019s on you! From the trailers to its marketing, there was never a message of \u201chey, this is pure action, humans vs. aliens!\u201d \r\n\r\nIt tried its best to give the world a different take on this \u201csub-genre\u201d, let\u2019s call it that. I mean, they had it all: a good cast with the always astonishing John Goodman (William Mulligan) as one of the protagonists, beautiful visual effects that elevated the set design, and the aliens actually have an intriguing physical shape. Sadly, there\u2019s barely any aliens throughout the runtime. There\u2019s hardly \u2026 anything. I don\u2019t know what happened post-production, but it feels like they were pushed to deliver something different, so they cut all of the other scenes with extra-terrestrial stuff (I\u2019m certain that they had more to show).\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is that you can never have a 100% ambiguous story. Arrival is probably the best non-typical alien-invasion movie ever, not because it scarcely shows any aliens or action, but due to its twistful and thought-provoking script. Nevertheless, it still shows a lot! You don\u2019t leave that film disappointed because you didn\u2019t see the inside of a spaceship or an actual alien. You leave perplexed and with your mind blown. Captive State just leaves you confused and wishing for more. A lot more. There\u2019s really not that much more to say on this review without getting into spoiler territory.\r\n\r\nSadly, this is one of those movies that come out every year showing tremendous potential, an innovative and intriguing premise, but that in the end, it just isn\u2019t able to succeed. It doesn\u2019t structure its story and ideas in the most efficient way possible. Its execution is sloppy, filled with hollow characters, no real flow (it feels like it\u2019s just a scene after another scene), too vague, and it profoundly hopes that you didn\u2019t figure out a pretty obvious twist so they can shock you seconds away from the end. It\u2019s not horrible, but it\u2019s definitely frustrating and disappointing.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman delivers a great performance as always, and the visual effects are striking, to say the least. The production quality is undeniable, they really worked hard to provide the audience with an environment that actually feels real. The first act is pretty good, but it\u2019s downhill from there. Ashton Sanders shares the lead with Goodman, and he\u2019s also pretty good, no doubt about it. However, and this sums up the film pretty well: if I have to check online what the name of the main character was (Gabriel Drummond), then something went terribly wrong. It\u2019s not going to end up being one of the worst movies of the year, but so far, it\u2019s the biggest letdown.\r\n\r\nRating: C-"

Away from the lead, the cinematography is pleasant as is the premise and support cast; for which Colin Farrell is the standout.\r\n\r\nIt's a real interesting legal drama. There's not much to note here without wanting to spoil things, but I can say it's worth your time."

Of course it was different than previous ones. It is a road movie, though all it reminded me was 'National Lampoon's Vaction'. It has been five years since the last film in the 'Wimpy Kid' series. I understand the reason for recasting, but still I expected to be what it is famous for.\r\n\r\nThe family decides to take a road trip, instead of flying to attend the grandma's 90th birthday. The mother wants it in an old way. That means no technology throughout the trip. But the kids are so addictive of their phones and so her husband. How they make it, and other troubles that they face during a long journey was told with some fun.\r\n\r\nYeah, I did not say the film isn't any fun. You would enjoy it, as a time pass film, but the laugh is hard to come by. Every bit of the film is one way or other, resembles other films. The actors were good, the direction was good, but not the writing. Despite all these flaws, the kids might enjoy it better than the adults. Just an average film, but not the worst film **as others saying.\r\n\r\n5/10**"

There\u2019s nothing redeeming about it, with every decision either ill-conceived or mishandled to the point of incompetence. In Favreau\u2019s hands, \u2018The Lion King\u2019 is rendered thunderously dull, lacking in any tension or complex characterisation, taking a laboriously long time to go nowhere and never once justifying its contentious existence. Even with my dislike of the original, I was flabbergasted at how thoroughly this film never attempts to understand why so many people love the 1994 film. If nothing else, this film makes it abundantly clear that Disney has no interest in making great cinema or honouring its own legacy. They don\u2019t care whether the film is good or whether you enjoy it. All they care about is using nostalgia to trick you into buying your ticket so they can make as much money off you as they can, and maybe if they throw some recognisable iconic moments from your childhood on the screen, they may even be able to fool you into thinking you\u2019d had a good time. \u2018The Lion King\u2019 is the ultimate diabolical apex of the commercialisation of nostalgia, and its inevitable box office success will just prove how easily we continue to be duped and how thoroughly they have trained us to not care about the quality of what we see. If this really is the future of mainstream cinema, then we are in serious, serious trouble.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-lion-king-a-catastrophic-and-soulless-remake-of-a-disney-classic"

Originally used as nothing more than an excuse to explain away \"Why don't they just call the cops?\" in your average home-invasion movie, the original _Purge_ movie had implied classism for the meat of it, and then an actual call to class division right at the end. Since then, the classism, and racism in American society has become a focal B-story to the _Purge_ movies, and now we're in 2018 for the prequel - _The First Purge_ - and those issues are now the whole point of the movie. Some might say that it's because the movies have lost any sense of subtlety, personally I think it's more that the creatives are sick of people missing the point.\r\n\r\n_The First Purge_ can't have been an easy thing to give the go-ahead in the current political climate over in the US, but it's important, and moreover, not a bad little film, socio-economic politics aside.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful surprise! I didn\u2019t watch any trailers or clips, I completely stayed away from any sort of marketing, but I couldn\u2019t hide from the negative feedback that social media was presenting. People online were skeptical of how good Will Smith\u2018s Genie would be, of how Mena Massoud (Aladdin) and Naomi Scott (Jasmine) were not the best casting choices, and of how the remake would actually honor and respect its original. From someone who didn\u2019t know what to expect, I thoroughly enjoyed Guy Ritchie\u2018s take on the retelling of this famous story. All of the fears described above are obliterated by a magical cast, and they\u2019re the ones who carry the movie to safe harbor.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll start with one out of two standout performances: Will Smith as the Genie. He delivers an indisputably unique and entertaining display as the blue entity. By the way he moves and talks, there\u2019s absolutely no way of people criticizing him for trying to copy Robin Williams. Smith does his own thing, and it works superbly. The best compliment I can give him is that I felt the same thing about Genie in this remake that I did while watching the original: every time he wasn\u2019t on screen, I wanted him to be back immediately. In the original, I thought that the Genie appeared in the right moments every single time, which was when the pacing started to drop too much.\r\n\r\nIn this remake, the periods without Genie are more extended, and the first act suffers a bit from its slow pace, and lack of truly fun sequences. Nevertheless, once the Cave of Wonders comes into play, it\u2019s a blast until the very end. The magic carpet and Abu make one hell of a comedy duo, and they\u2019re responsible for a lot of the laughs throughout the runtime. Going back to Genie, I love that Ritchie and John August gave him something more in comparison with the original, and that\u2019s one of few improvements actually made to the original. I wrote on that review that I was hoping that they gave more time for the core relationship of the film to develop and that Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) was more than just a paper-thin villain\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, Jafar keeps being an evil sorcerer that only desires power to rule everything and everyone. Unfortunately, he has more screentime than its predecessor, which means more over-the-top monologues of Kenzari, and sillier sequences with the whole hypnosis trick. On the other hand, Jasmine and Aladdin have a fully-developed script, which is by far the best improvement on the original. Their relationship grows naturally, and each character gets a lot of moments to express their feelings and show who they truly are, especially Jasmine. She is directly connected to an issue that will definitely make this movie incredibly divisive, audience and critics alike, but I\u2019ll address it more at the end of the review.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the characters, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott deliver breakthrough performances. Massoud is funny and quite likable as Aladdin, but Naomi is an absolute standout. Now, we look at this film as just another Disney remake. In a few years, we\u2019ll look at Aladdin (2019) as the movie that launched Naomi Scott into the stardom. She is astonishingly outstanding as Jasmine. Not only her voice is pretty amazing, but her acting is unbelievably seamless. Regarding singing, Will Smith and Mena Massoud are also pretty good, and the musical numbers are another aspect that I surprisingly loved. Prince Ali, Friend Like Me, A Whole New World and the new song, Speechless, are beautiful, powerful, and the first two\u2019s production design and VFX are overwhelming in a good way.\r\n\r\nGuy Ritchie is known for his very fluid chasing sequences, and Aladdin running through Agrabah is very well filmed as expected. However, the long choreographed takes during these musical scenes are a wonder to behold, from the first to the very last one, even after the \u201cThe End\u201d tagline shows up. A perfect remake is one that is able to keep the original\u2019s essence while being its own thing. Ritchie does an impressive job balancing these pillars. For anyone who loves the original and wanted the remake to be a shot-by-shot retell of the story, every single little detail (from key words to important character moments) is present in this film. For anyone who wanted a different take, there\u2019s more than enough minor changes to either how the story proceeds (order of events, more character development) or even how it ends, which leads me to the above-mentioned divisive issue.\r\n\r\nEvery time a political or social agenda is inserted in a movie, people don\u2019t care if it\u2019s well-written or not. They just don\u2019t want any of those things on any film, and I support that. Hollywood needs to stop trying to put something politically or socially correct in a movie, just for the sake of it. Aladdin (2019) has a clear social message, and it uses one of the main characters to state that message clearly. Now, here\u2019s the catch: having in mind the character in question, how it\u2019s written, and what they do to send that social message, I think it\u2019s fine. Yes, I know that a lot of people will think the complete opposite and crucify the film for it. I usually do the following mental exercise: \u201cDoes it make sense with the story/character? Is it just a single moment during the movie (proving that it might be too forced) or do they develop the idea? If it was an original film, would I even be thinking about this?\u201d\r\n\r\nYes. They develop the idea. Probably not. Those are my answers, and that\u2019s why I stand on the positive side of this soon-to-be heavily discussed subject during a few days. People need to start opening their minds to these modern takes on pre-21st-century classics. I always use Dumbo (1941) as an example: this is probably the most racist Disney movie ever, with extreme discrimination, total disrespect for animals, alcohol-induced plot points, and so much more morally and socially wrong storylines and character\u2019s personalities. There\u2019s no way that a film like that can be released today! So, obviously, Dumbo (2019) had to be extremely different from that one-hour racism show.\r\n\r\nAladdin (1992) also has a particular aspect about it that it doesn\u2019t quite fit nowadays\u2019 culture. It\u2019s not offensive or anything, but I bet that if it was released today, a whole group of people would complain about it. Aladdin (2019) tries to adapt, and while it might have tried too hard, I still appreciate the effort, and at least it makes sense. It\u2019s only a minor change to the core story and to the character in question, so it' shouldn\u2019t affect the overall viewing of the movie. If Speechless wasn\u2019t created, it would have been totally fine, but I have to admit that even if the song sounds great and the lyrics are impactful, it\u2019s still a stretch\u2026 Naomi Scott interprets it beautifully, though.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is stunning. Agrabah is an absolute delight that will make hardcore fans\u2019 jaws drop continuously, each time a new location is shown. I love how Ritchie strolls the camera around to show-off his production crew beautiful work, most of the times through long and fluid takes. I wish (no pun intended) he could have controlled the movie\u2019s pace and tone better. Periods without Genie to entertain the audience are too long, and Ritchie shouldn\u2019t risk the boredom levels to be as high as they are occasionally.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Aladdin (2019) succeeds in balancing the two pillars of any remake: it keeps the original\u2019s true essence while standing on its own. Will Smith shuts down online skeptics with a super entertaining and unique performance as Genie, but it\u2019s Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud palpable chemistry that surprised the hell out of me. The latter is perfect as Aladdin, but Naomi has her breakthrough display, which is definitely going to take her to even bigger stages. Guy Ritchie proves he\u2019s a fantastic director, by delivering some beautiful one-take sequences and exceptionally fun and well-choreographed musical numbers. Technically, the production and set design are astounding, but the pacing-tone levels aren\u2019t as balanced as they should have been, which makes the runtime over-extend itself.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, people will feel incredibly divisive. Most of the screenplay is identical to its predecessor, but Disney\u2019s attempt to force down a social message is not going to help the film, at all. Even if it makes sense and it\u2019s only a minor twist, it was still unnecessary, and it might even shadow Naomi\u2018s brilliant performance, which would be a massive shame. Jafar bothers me a lot more than any of this stuff. However, Ritchie and John August deserve nothing but compliments for trying so hard to adapt such a risky original and mostly succeed doing it. I genuinely hope it crushes in the box office. It\u2019s really a diamond (in the rough). Go watch it and make your own opinion!\r\n\r\nRating: B+"
