            "review": "> The famous English detective at his old age.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen as Sherlock Holmes, totally loved it. Directed by an Oscar winning filmmaker, the film was based on the novel 'A Slight Trick of the Mind'. It focused the long retired Sherlock Holmes, who now lives in the English countryside where he meets a boy. He tries to recall one of his old cases, but struggles as he's very old to remember. So with the help of the boy, he undertakes to correct the book version of the story and besides, they together establish beekeeping as a hobby.\r\n\r\nIt was not that great, though an enjoyable small drama. Having a greatest detective character in it, you just can't expect a boring regular drama of the life. The narration had a multiple layer, in each how much Mr. Holmes dedicates himself to solves the case was nicely told. And of course, all of them had its own twist. After all, that's what everybody seeks from a film with Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you would have seen several films and/or series based on this character, but this film was something unique and only one kind, except if there's a sequel planned for this. Some people might be disappointed in this for being somewhat simple, but for a 93 year old man this storyline looked very appropriate and Ian did a fantastic job. I anticipated someone young actor for those flashback parts, but in the end, I'm happy that it was a one man show as it should be. It is a must see for his fans.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "> Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.\r\n\r\nWe all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.\r\n\r\nThe both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\r\n\r\n> \"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\r\n\r\n> \"When I was small, I only knew small things.\r\n> But now I'm five, I know everything.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.\r\n\r\nWhen a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.\r\n\r\nThere were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.\r\n\r\n9/10"

That means it is good for the grown ups to watch. The story of a 15 year old girl in the 70s living with her mother and small sister. It begins when her sexual urges takes off, her first with a middle aged man. So she documents everything and besides, with her close friend's support, they together explore even more options. Being a minor and yet her real life to commence, what she plans for the future determines the remaining developments.\r\n\r\nThe performance by Bel Powley was amazing. She was the perfect choice to play that role despite she's older than the role. There were many nudes and sex scenes, but was not that strong, especially when compared with the similar themes of the present era films. The pace had lots of ups and downs, but the progression was on the right path which actually saved the film.\r\n\r\nThe story was just fine, no complication to understand and also not easy to explain, but in a short, it was a teenage girl's sexual exploration. Everybody gets into that stage of life, but only few courageously opts a path to accomplish. And for some, it is an open opportunity that makes them to get there than intentionally make that move. I felt the film was well adapted from its book and directed by a newcomer, Surely worth a watch, but again I'm saying that it is not for everyone.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

In fact, it was a minimal cast movie set in an isolated cabin in the woods. A simple story that is like the title, it is about a newly married couple's honeymoon. All sets off nicely to them until strange events begin to follow one after another. How the couple manages to come off of it, or do they is the rest.\r\n\r\nI don't know others, but like I said it was not a bad movie to me. Whatever happened, it just kept me engaged throughout, because of the uptight plot. Though, it raises some questions about the events that takes place in the movie and makes to have your own imagination. In fact, my opinion in the begging was 'big foot', later very quickly I understood what it's about. The writer's notion was also the same, leaving blank space to fill by the viewers with their creative prediction.\r\n\r\nThe most of the answers answered or going to be answered are merely the same (I think). For those who won't get it, will suffer nothing except think they wasted time. The rest will probably want a sequel for a proper and further explanation. Especially a couple of dialogues made me think that way. But, I don't think so there will be one, it will stay a mystery as of now forever, if I'm not wrong. Not a scary movie nor actual violence, but the suspense was the movie's strong hold. If you're looking for that type, you can give it a try other than blood gore and killings.\r\n\r\n5.5/10"

            "review": "These days one can find busy singer/dancer/actress Jennifer Lopez performing her judging duties on the small screen with the longtime singing competition \u2018American Idol\u2019. However, the still radiant and curvaceous \u2018JLo\u2019 found some time to gravitate back to the big screen and revisit the overplayed \u2018woman in peril\u2019 genre with her latest generic psychological thriller in director Rob Cohen\u2019s (\u2018The Fast And The Furious\u2019) \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019. Needlessly rehashed, rudimentary and titillating in tepidness, \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 is nothing more than a thin serving of the arbitrary \u2018damsel-in-distress\u2019 chick flicks that pop up and serve as throwaway conveyor belt melodramas. \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 will inevitably beg for obvious comparisons to ready-made Lifetime cable movies. Well, there are a decent amount of Lifetime movies that can actually give the limping \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 a run for its creative money.\r\n\r\nIn essence, Lopez is no stranger to these types of \u2018harried heroines\u2019 on the defense so she is quite comfortable in rollicking in the paper-thin premise of \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019. In forgettable 2001\u2019s \u2018Angel Eyes\u2019 and 2002\u2019s \u2018Enough\u2019 we witness Lopez\u2019s on-screen dilemma as the creepy men in her life are ominously drawn to her aura causing the heightened jeopardy at large. The case in \u2018Boy\u2019 is similar except that the delusional young man in question is as dreamy as he is deranged for the endangered cougar. Hey, he may be crazed but he is still cute, right ladies?\r\n\r\nThe reality is that we have seen this formula countless times before as \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 offers nothing fresh or feisty to the table. The teaspoon-sized tension is laughable. The run-of-the-mill steamy scenes are not even trashy enough to digest with notable suspense. Undoubtedly, \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 recklessly borrows from every psycho-thriller imaginable and still ends up looking bland and boorish. With all the loving-to-stalking fare out there past and present (ie \u2018Fatal Attraction\u2019, \u2018The Crush\u2019, \u2018Fear\u2019, \u2018Swimfan\u2019, \u2018Disclosure\u2019, \u2018Obsessed\u2019, etc.) the inclusion of \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 only clogs up the cinematic pipe in reference to this overdone genre.\r\n\r\nUnder Cohen\u2019s pedestrian direction and screenwriter Barbara Curry\u2019s spotty script \u2018Boy\u2019 tells the tale of an attractive middle-aged high school teacher named Claire Peterson (Lopez) whose bout with disillusionment will result in her tawdry affair with a neighboring handsome younger man in 19 year-old Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman from the \u2018Step It Up\u2019 movies). Before Claire falls into the arms of her youthful studmuffin she is riddled with conflict. For starters, her unfaithful husband Garrett (John Corbett, \u2018My Big Fat Greek Wedding\u2019) was banished from the house for his constant infidelities. Also, Claire\u2019s sickly teen son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is experiencing growing pains. At this point, Claire needs a positive boost in her existence as she trudges along both in the classroom and at home, where her personal life seems to be in utter shambles.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunkish Noah arrives on the scene to assist his ailing uncle across the street from the Petersons, he makes a lasting impression on the older Claire. Noah is helpful to Claire and becomes sort of the manly mentor that her son Kevin needs to capture his adolescent confidence. Of course, Noah\u2019s backstory is quite suspicious (such as his parents\u2019 so-called mysterious death) but the oozing charm and good company that the older teen offers the stressed Claire is too convenient to pass up. Noah is just too good to be true and Claire has found a young man worthy of entertaining both her and Kevin.\r\n\r\nThe yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher's preferred pet to Lopez's lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR\r\nThe yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher\u2019s preferred pet to Lopez\u2019s lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR\r\nIn the aftermath of a horrible date arranged by her close friend and school vice principal Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth), Claire lets down her guard and succumbs to her sexual urge for Noah in a hasty moment of passion. Realizing that perhaps her bedtime dalliance with Noah was a mistaken indiscretion Claire informs Noah that they can no longer go on and act upon their carnal connection. This does not sit well with Noah at all. Soon, Claire will experience the psychotic wrath of her scorned young admirer whose smothering need to be with her becomes hauntingly overwhelming. The stakes are dangerously higher when the forgiven Garrett re-enters the picture in an effort to win back Claire\u2019s broken heart.\r\n\r\nOverall, the low-budgeted \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 simply fills in the cheesy blanks with its amateurish jitters. Lopez\u2019s angst-ridden Claire has all the frightened chops of a ransom hayride during a busy livestock convention. The lackluster acting by leads Lopez and Guzman are not impish or impulsive enough to care one way or the other. Corbett\u2019s cheating hubby Garrett feels like a mere footnote in the flaccid proceedings.

There were moments were I went \u201cOh Harry\u2019s used that same spell before!\u201d or characters that fitted naturally into the narrative being mentioned, as opposed to getting all _Agents of SHIELD_ season 1 on us, and awkwardly name-dropping something from the other films every 5 minutes, just in case we forgot, which was what I was afraid it might do.\r\n\r\nEnd result, _Fantastic Beasts_ is a flawed film that I was still very happy to have watched, and exceeded my expectations.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._"

Communism and United States are like two opposite poles. So portraying an American who supports it is a challenging task for any moviemakers. But the director of 'Meet the Parents' did a great job. Yep, you don't have to take sides while a watch. Of course, the movie discussed the issue of conflict over the types of ruling system, but it was only in the initial part that kind of looked strong. While the story advancing, that topic completely weakened and concentrated more on other stuffs. So don't expect it to be a fight for the constitutional, but a wonderful biography of one of the talented screenwriters in the history of Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCommunism or Democracy, whatever you support that does not matter here to choose whether you want watch it or not. Because this movie very smartly outlined how people are affected when they believe differently from the majority of others around. In the opening, I thought it could be an anti-hero tale, but later it transformed the angle of presentation and indeed in the end the main character turned into a most likeable one.\r\n\r\nI liked Dalton Trumbo, not for what he preferred to support, but how he handled it all. The rival group is who made it a big concern, otherwise he is a neglectable for his egoist nature. Bryan Cranston was amazing in the title role. It's his best in the lead role, after only to the 'Breaking Bad'. Hope he's going to make more lead role films now after. Kind of of inspiring flick, of course, from his professional angle. Definitely one of the best films of the 2015 and deserved its Oscar nod.\r\n\r\n8/10"

            "review": "> Going across the Atlantic to find the lost love.\r\n\r\nA western movie set in the 1870 United States, but entirely shot in the New Zealand. The story of a 16 year old boy, Jay, from Scotland embarks a journey in the New World in search of his love, Rose. Later a bounty hunter joins him and makes sure his safe travel. Technically, it was a road movie, but reveals the plot from the other angles as well in the spare times like during camping at the nights.\r\n\r\nThe narration was too slow and the story was ordinary, but it was enough for me to get engaged. If you wait until the final scene, especially till you figure out the puzzle of the romance theme, you may like it better. The end was so good, just like what a western movie fan looking for, a gunfight. Interestingly, that was not to be heroic, except all the earlier disasters pushed for the finale and the post finale. It is rated R, because it is so brutal in some way and for being faithful to the genre.\r\n\r\nIt might not be a dream debut for the director like the big cast, the high budget and a great commercial success, but giving a satisfying movie in a simple way was his accomplishment in his first attempt. Kodi Smith-McPhee is almost 20 and he's yet to play his independent and powerful enough character that will bring acknowledgement. It was a close one, the narration started like it was his, and he was everywhere in the movie. Then going further, especially when it nears the end, he was kind of fading. But he was awesome, along with Michael Fassbender. Not a must see, as well as not refusable if you get a chance to see it.\r\n\r\n7.5/10"

I don't know what's the reason, but surprisingly it was a much better film than I expected. It had a decent cast, particularly for a small budget horror, it was a well made film. Even the screen-writing was good. They should have improved it a bit, but still not a bad film with all the fine performances.\r\n\r\nThis is about a man who can enter the minds of the possessed ones by the evil spirits. Like most of the horror films, the exorcist has a person feud with one particular spirit. So after searching for it many years, he finds that a boy was possessed by the same spirit. Now it's his time to avenge whatever he had suffered from earlier in his life.\r\n\r\nThe horror film fans and film fanatics might think it is an average, but for the common people it will work fine. There are some good moments in the film. Overall, well designed film in those crucial parts. You are going to see totally a different Aaron Eckhart, especially being in the lead. So I feel it is worth a try.\r\n\r\n_6\u00bd/10_"
