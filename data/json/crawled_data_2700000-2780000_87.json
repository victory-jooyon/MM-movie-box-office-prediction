Most of all I would recommend it to Batman fans, because there's a couple of tiny little off-the-cuff references you'll get an extra kick out of, but it'll also work for fans of the original _Lego Movie_, and for kids too.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._"

            "review": "_By JD Phillips, geekr.org_\r\n\r\nThe Harry Potter movies are great but one of the main flaws of the original franchise was the struggle the films had condensing the lengthy novels into movies under three hours. Despite the Fantastic Beasts sequel not being based on a book, it still somehow feels like its stressing to condense a five hundred page book into a smaller narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie runs from scenario to scenario so quickly that it\u2019s hard to remember what all happened in its muddled story. That\u2019s not to say the film is terrible at all, surprisingly. For a movie that has serious pacing problems throughout and has more interest in setting up sequels than it is at finding a memorable plot of its own, it\u2019s actually very entertaining.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe returning cast members are all back and while none leave quite the impression they did before they\u2019re all still entertaining in their own way. Newt is back but the movie doesn\u2019t seem nearly as interested in him and his magical monsters than it is with all of the new elements. Redmayne is still terrific in the role, however, and makes the character much more interesting than the script does by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob and Tina are back as well though both of their stories are shelved for most of the film and completely forgotten in the final moments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise though is that Queenie gets the best arc of any character in the movie. She was one of the more interesting characters in the original and while many of the twists in the film fall flat, the one involving her character was my favorite moment of the entire movie. I\u2019m more excited to see her story resolved than I am most of the other elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone who has seen the trailers that the new characters kind of take over the film from the returning players. Jude Law and Johnny Depp\u2019s Dumbledore and Grindelwald are what this film is more focused on than any other plot element.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth veteran actors shine so much that the movie loses energy when they aren\u2019t on screen. Law effortlessly settles into Dumbledore\u2019s twinkly-eyed wise, yet manipulative schtick.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepp also kills it as Grindelwald. In fact, it pains me to say this because of how much of an ass the actor is in real life, this is the most I\u2019ve liked Depp as a performer since his first time playing Jack Sparrow. He avoids most of the oddball antics he\u2019s been milking for so many years and delivers a subdued, terrifying performance as Grindelwald. He more than holds his own against Ralph Fiennes, which is saying something.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new players are a mixed bag. Zoe Kravitz\u2019s Leta Lastrange is an interesting character but none of the others really stand out. Newt\u2019s brother Theseus is a particularly big missed opportunity. The film never adequately explains what caused the rivalry between the two Scamanders and it all gets resolved before there\u2019s a chance to go into it more. Claudia Kim\u2019s Nagini may have caused a big stir when she was announced in one of the trailers but very little is actually done with her character. It feels more like a stunt than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest stunt comes from the big reveal in the end featuring Ezra Miller\u2019s Credence. There\u2019s a huge twist that not only breaks established history but feels extremely forced. For one, the movie never really explains how Credence came back to life in the first place. It feels like Ezra Miller became a bigger commodity for DC since he is the Flash so now the franchise is committing more to him than initially intended. There was no hint at all in the first movie that he was secretly connected to existing characters in a big way, so it seems out of left field. Regardless, I love Ezra Miller and hope the twist gets him better material in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie doesn\u2019t feel much like a Fantastic Beasts franchise anymore but when it does focus on its titular magical creatures, it really shines. The design and concept of the creatures lead to some of the best visuals of the entire Harry Potter pantheon. In fact, it feels like a real shame that we can\u2019t get a smaller franchise that is just about Newt\u2019s magical zoological adventures. The quieter moments of the movies where Newt is just connecting with a magical animal on its own terms are truly beautiful. Unfortunately, these moments get overtaken by the larger story around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like this franchise is straining to be two different franchises at the same time. It would almost make more sense to separate them into a smaller scale \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise and a larger scale \u201cCrimes of Grindelwald\u201d franchise. This mishmash of different ideas is feeling a little too much like the Hobbit films.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow though, despite all of the messiness of the movie\u2019s screenplay, I still found myself entertained throughout. While it may never hit the heights of its legendary predecessors, this film easily proves that the Wizarding World still has lots of magic left. Maybe the executives at Warner Bros should consider other avenues like television or other films so that Newt\u2019s film series doesn\u2019t carry the weight of one of the most magical film series ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d may not rise to the levels one would hope for, it still proves itself to be worth your time, if even just for one viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n**7.0**"

There is simply no reason for this to be 155 minutes long, there's so much unnecessary faffing about. There's a fantastic spine to the film, but it's just flooded by lameness.\r\n\r\nRanbir Kapoor is entertaining in the lead, he very much commits to the role of Jagga - he's amusing but does have a few moments of heart also. Katrina Kaif (Shruti) and Saswata Chatterjee (Bagchi) support Kapoor extremely well. A few of the others, like Saurabh Shukla, are decent too.\r\n\r\nThe music is pretty good, the core premise has potential and the cinematography et al. is solid. I'm not completely sold on how the story is told, I mostly liked it but the back and forth nature does annoy in a few parts.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's worth a watch - but snappier pacing would've raised this film up higher in my ratings."

Sometimes its common that some films comes out without my knowledge, particularly non-Hollywood English language films. This British film was about a wealthy couple from the New York, especially the husband who tries his best to fulfill his seriously ill wife's dream to be an opera singer. The problem is she's not any good. Not just him, but everybody who is close to them and once laughed at her, try to understand them and give their support. But not all the occasion seems to remain the same. So on one such a big event, the disaster strikes and how it affects the couple is the rest of the tale to disclose.\r\n\r\nA very surprising film. I thought it was just a comedy like it brings small smiles on our face, but I laughed out loud on many occasions. This is definitely a right time, because I felt like it was a music and cinematic version of the American presidential candidate Don Trump. Yep, there not much difference, but still this film is some way inspiring, not Trump. It says you must never give up on your dream. As much as you laugh watching it, as much you realise how hard chasing a dream to be if one is very passionate about something, but does not have the talent to reach the height. The message is very similar to the film 'Eddie the Eagle'. Do you think everybody got talent in the world, so I believe you should watch this and you will know why I'm telling you to watch it.\r\n\r\nWhen I read about the film's storyline, I thought it was so silly. But when I learnt it is a biographical film, that interested me to have a look at it. It is truly an unbelievable film, in a sense of humour and overall a good way. The couple was rich, so they could do anything they want just like what Donald Trump believes. But both the things are not the same, especially this one is more about the real life struggle against the odds. In some parts, it gets more emotional and I loved that final line said by the wife. It's always, the participation that counts, not how you fared it.\r\n\r\nOh my god, another Oscars nominee is almost certain for the record holder Meryl Streep. Hugh Grant was equally amazing and this is one of the best of him I have seen, particularly in the recent times. One of the best main roles for Simon Helberg, he was not next best after the Streep and Grant. I still feel this film is underrated. The director of 'Phenomena' was very good at handling the stuff for the film to get its best shape. I think this is one of this year's must see film and surely recommend it to all.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"

I don't know these actors or the director, but that's not the reason I did not enjoy it. The story was average, like it was inspired by the Keanu Reeve's 'John Wick'. I mean, how far a man can go to avenge his pet animal's murder, but here it was a rescue mission. Maybe that's how they got the title, just kidding. A very interesting theme, but not a well written screenplay. This story lacks the clever scenes and dialogues. The comedies were not bad, but I've seen better one in a similar style.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins decide to hangout when one of them is going through the breakup thing with his girlfriend and the other one's family is going on a vacation. Seems everything is fine after they receive an unexpected guest, a kitty to cheer them, but when it goes missing, they plan to track him to get back. So the mission begins and they pose as the notorious drug dealers and go through many hurdles, but will they succeed is what the film is to reveal in the final act.\r\n\r\nWhen the film posters released, I already lost interest in this. Because those imitating posters of other famous films were totally unimpressive. Beside, those kind of idea is old, not anymore fun and I'm tired of them. This is a below average film, but a decent B movie. The production was top notch, but the film did not deliver with the same standards. The twist was good, in the end, it was very common. If you are okay with a simple and silly concept, then this would do just fine.\r\n\r\n_4/10_"

I saw sneak preview a few months back and it was the full-length feature but it was missing music in the end credit section and may have some added additional editing since then.  What I did see, it was on par with Thor: Dark World in quality and has higher wokeness than Han Solo and Star War: Last Jedi. Probably worst Marvel movie since the start of this universe started with the great Iron Man...only thing that could have been worse if Inhuman movie was made. So hold on to your money and maybe watch this at 2nd run theater ($1.75 each...maybe $3 at most) or online free...so you know how this added character will lessen the Avenger's End Game plot. The CGI special effects are just okay but the simpleton story, underwhelming acting and almost-no character development are at the expense to make this the tops of any recent movies with its wokeness and identity politics\u2026And Brie Larson character is just boring with no depth\u2026just like Disney did to current Star Wars movies' female lead. DEFINITELY do NOT spend the money to see it on IMAX or any other expensive premium screenings or waiting in line on opening weekend. Maybe newer version (a few years back) Ghostbust(-h)ers was slightly better...which is not saying much. Already seeing highly rated tweets from critics, I am sure these are the same movie critics that gave great ratings to last years movies, \"The Favourite\" and \"Sorry to Bother You\". Yeah, Don't see this either!"

Last year\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5"

Perhaps the audience could also benefit from a little pre-screening bongy haze of their own."

However, Rudo's way of life is threatened under the yoke of occupying forces from Japan, who took over the nation in 1895. As Rudo sees the traditions and honor of his people stripped away, he realizes the time has come to fight back, and in 1930 he brings together a group of former Seediq Bale soldiers, many of whom have been reduced to infighting, and molds them into a revolutionary army. Rudo and his comrades make their stand when they confront Japanese occupation troops at a youth athletic event, leading to a violent confrontation between the Seediq forces and their oppressors. Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale - Part 2: The Rainbow Bridge is Part two of the two-part, four-hour Taiwanese edition of the film Warriors of the Rainbow.",

Based on the true story where the most of the film was the 13 hour long armed battle event took place in Libya, 2012. I remember the middle-east's protest over the western films, this story is set in the same time when the islamic terrorists targeted the American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, but six brave men stood and fought against the uprising.\r\n\r\nIt is an American patriotic film, but because of the hatred over their own countrymen Michael Bay, they're surely missing a nearly a war masterpiece. The rest of the world saw it as a fine film and appreciated that. If you haven't seen it yet, I say just don't ignore it. It was a well made realistic war film, the actors were amazing and the scenes were suspenseful to spectacular. Definitely one of the best in this theme.\r\n\r\nIt was simply focused on the armed conflict between the two forces, so it won't reasons out us how and where it all began, because that might take another film to tell the tale. That's really a very clever writing. In this 150 minute long film, the first act was full of characters and story development. Then begins the gun fight that commences from the dust hours till the dawn breaks out. With many twists in the narration during confrontation, surely not a film to be missed.\r\n\r\n8/10"

            "review": "> He's obviously the same person, but his intentions are?\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the director's previous works like 'Combat Girls' and 'Wetlands'. Those were young women oriented subjects, yet filled with sensitive topics. But now he turned his focus towards the screen adaptation of a bestselling satirical novel of the same name about Adolf Hitler. Well, this is not his best work, not a bad movie either.\r\n\r\nQuite fun to watch, but not logical, especially the basic ones. Since it mocks a most hated person in the human history, there's no issues on portraying him in whatever angle they wanted, because nobody cares. Yet the film talked some serious current issues of Germany.\r\n\r\nThis is like when 'Borat' meets 'The Dictator'. A man who wanders around a city looking for some answers. That's none other than Adolf Hitler, who wakes up in the middle of where some young kids showing their football skills for a tv programme. Then he embarks to learn where he's and what year it is. Meets a person who helps him and ultimately end up with some tv guy where they begin their journey throughout the nation making videos before landing in an actual tv show. The man who killed millions of people wants the best for Germany and its people, how he turn things around were narrated in a quite interesting perspective.\r\n\r\nThe initial narratives were like the aimless, that tells us what people think of the Adolf Hitler's return. Looked like most of them were shot like a documentary style, outside the official shooting spots. You can see lots of real people's faces were censored. We know that he wanted to be an artist, but he draws some funny sketches in this. Likewise there are many scenes about his qualities that were dragged in to make fun out of it.\r\n\r\nCan people accept the words of one who is considered a villain. He came from a different timeline, but he quickly absorbs the situation and gives some important tips that should come into force. From the common people's perspective, it is an entertaining product, but from the political viewpoint, there are stuffs to consider severely about.\r\n\r\n> \"When you have rats at home, it is called not a clown but an exterminator.\"\r\n\r\nTo me there's nothing controversial about this theme. When he failed, the final pages of his history book were written by his enemies. Otherwise, there's no difference between him, Alexander and Genghis Khan. Every greatest kings who ever lived on the earth dreamed of conquering the world.\r\n\r\nI think the present world is same, except the form of conquering is changed, like some want to rule the world with their strong economy like the US and some are on their cheap industrial products like China. Like that all the other nations are on the top of the chart with something in what they're good at.\r\n\r\nAdolf Hitler was a politician, not a king, but he had his reasons for his actions. So if we go by the rule books, nothing seems rational. To me this film was a decent entertainer, I just wanted to enjoy what it offers and I think I did. I advise the same that you should not mix up this with the reality. Because that might take us to the unwanted territory.\r\n\r\nHe's the same person who came from the past, but I was keen to know his intentions, especially what the writer intended to draw out of him. Because he's alone, not with his army, so he had no power, but his interaction with people brings up some discussable topics. I'm not a German, but it made me think when he spoke about current issues that Germany is facing. Every nation has to think about its internal affairs to improve it, you can't live forever with the past shame.\r\n\r\nThis film might be a comedy, but you can't ignore some of the points the main character talks. I felt the movie was a double strike where people can have some laughs and in other side to learn the reality of the state. This the best satirical film about Adolf Hitler I've seen after the Charles Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "Traditionally, horror films and psychological thrillers follow a predictable path in their themes of dot-to-dot suspense. Rarely does a suspense piece deviate away from the formulaic blueprint that make these types of flicks the familiar frightfests they are in conception. However, the crafty Joel Edgerton, as the juggling movie mastermind sporting directing, acting and writing credits, provides the mind-bending goods in the refreshingly titillating \u2018The Gift\u2019, an edge-of-your-seat chiller that definitely is worth unwrapping with nervous anticipation. The ambitious moments in \u2018The Gift\u2019 are golden especially when the twists and turns are considered a solid fixture in the film\u2019s creepy conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is understandable in assuming that \u2018The Gift\u2019 could have been yet another custom-made psychological thriller promoting the same hire-for-dire predicaments. Nevertheless, the insidious presence of Edgerton, along with co-stars Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall, as the Chicagoan married couple settling in their aesthetic-looking LA-based home elevates \u2018The Gift\u2019 as a stalker flick with captivating smarts and attitude.\r\n\r\nIt is actually a homecoming situation for Simon (Bateman) as he returns to his California town courtesy of his job-related executive rise within his computer security firm. The mover-and-shaker couple Simon and Robyn (Hall) settle into their impressive, spacious window-friendly place with a modern innovative appearance. When the couple decides to head out and do some furniture shopping they bump into Gordon (Edgerton). Gordon identifies himself as Simon\u2019s old high school classmate, something that catches the computer exec by surprise because he does not necessary recall the goatee-sporting Gordon right off the bat. The greeting is awkward but Simon politely acknowledges Gordon in an effort to appease him.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, jotting down the clingy Gordon\u2019s phone number is opening up a proverbial can of worms. Soon, Simon and Robyn would be hindered by Gordon\u2019s constant intrusive visits to their elegant home. Furthermore, Gordon adds to the creep factor by bestowing different degrees of generous gifts on the marital twosome. Gordon does not seem to take the hint that his unannounced visitations are smothering and rather bothersome to the lovebirds. The nervy gesture of Gordon hanging around is particularly worrisome because he seems to dominate Robyn\u2019s attention and time as Simon is away  at his lucrative job during the day.\r\n\r\nThe tension mounts for Simon and Robyn outside of the menacing interruptions caused by the mysterious Gordo. For starters, the pressure is on for the tandem to start a family as they hope to entertain the arrival of their first child. Secondly, Simon tries to best a rival at work to further his corporate ladder climbing into management. Thus, Gordon\u2019s bizarre gift-giving tendencies and continual pit stops in the couple\u2019s blossoming lives purely add to the stress and strain of keeping their marriage solid and conflict-free.\r\n\r\nThe Gift could have followed its road map to predictability and used the oddball Gordon as the doomsday dude that continues his twisted agenda without any rhyme or reason. Here is where Edgerton, as the aforementioned triple threat in directing, writing and acting, earns his creative stripes because he manages to flip the script on the viewers and causes them to comprehend the off-kilter motivations of this complex agitator. Is Gordon justified in his campaign to cause havoc for the corporate rising star Simon? Is Simon as squeaky clean as it appears? What is the backstory surrounding the nostalgic circumstances concerning Gordon\u2019s and Simon\u2019s past history as childhood classmates together? Can Robyn piece together the perplexing puzzle that involves the two men on different avenues to self-destruction?\r\n\r\nIt would be a disservice to reveal some of the shocking angles in \u2018The Gift\u2019 because the film certainly engineers must of its nerve-racking twists so cleverly to the point of describing too much of the dramatic layers may spoil the tension-driven surprise. The overall toxic message that is conveyed pretty much sums up Edgerton\u2019s inventive and piercing thrill ride. Be careful how you mistreat or dismiss someone from the past on the way up because you very well could tangle with them as one\u2019s fortunes could descend without a moment\u2019s notice.  Or to put it in simplistic street-wise terminology: karma is indeed a bitch!\r\n\r\nThe Gift (2015)\r\n\r\nSTX Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr. 48 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton, Allison Tolman, Busy Phillipps, Beau Knapp, Wendell Pierce and David Denman\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Joel Edgerton\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Psychological Thriller/Suspense and Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n"

            "review": "**Assassinating the nazi general was their mission, but it initiated the resistance.**\r\n\r\nHonestly, I thought it was some science fiction film. The title sounded like one, so I had to google for its definition. This is an assassination theme, that sets in the early 40s in the Czechoslovakia. The early days of the world war two, where the exile soldiers were sent to eliminate the nazi general Reinhard Heydrich, who was handling the Czechoslovakian affairs. From theirs preparation to the plan execution and the outcome of the result was what this film reveals for us.\r\n\r\nA war film, that too was based on the real, especially the WWII means no need to say how powerful it would be. This was directed by the 'Metro Manila' filmmaker. An internationally produced film, but the cast does not have any big names. I mean Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy are not globally recognised, particularly when it comes to the film marketing. So it stumbled at the box office. I liked them both and the others as well. The film was not bad as criticised by the film critics. I would say make your own call after watching it.\r\n\r\nIt was so neat and clean on what it dealt with. The issue with it was too much blank space and then in the mid part where the assassination happened, the film came alive. Again towards the final, the pace gone up and finished strongly. So I think overall length should have been trimmed for a better narration/result. Not for me, I liked as it is now, but some viewers think it is a draggy.\r\n\r\nSmall budget film, but worth a watch. Because the production quality was great, no compromise on visuals or the settings, but most of them were shot in the real locations to give us the real effect. Definitely one of the best film among WWII related theme. Anyway, this is not a war film, but very much similar to the recent Korean film 'Assassination' about killing the Japanese general. Films like this are must see, because it reveals how much the people, the society and the nation struggled under the nazi atrocities. Surely recommended!\r\n\r\n_8/10_"

Such films are really worth a watch, before that, worth to be made. But did it depicted accurately is what we don't know. So here the effort should be appreciated and everyone who involved in it. It was about the African-Americans during the early 19th century. The film focused on a boy who learnt to read and write became a preacher. He taught his community about all the good and bad. But it all comes into question when he realises that what he reads in the book is not the same in the real world. He has been in the path of non-violence all his life and now at the crossroad, he forced to take a weapon and fight back for the freedom.\r\n\r\nAn inspiring film. If it was well written and made, would have been an Oscar material. Though the actors were good and well shot in locations. Nate Parker was brilliant in the lead, as well his direction was not bad, particularly in his first attempt. Previously, he had done some fine roles, but this is his best appearance. Perfect length and pace to sit for it patiently looking for the next events in the narration. Had some too much violence in a few scenes, but those were very much needed. Despite the film telling a true story, it did not appeal enough due to the lack of proper improvement in narration. Which I blame for not availability of proper information and records. Surely one of the best among in the year, not one of the top films of the year. So it is a must see then.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

The entire film feels like it\u2019s written using nothing more than the vocabulary of a 12 year old and consists of two very tiring hours of repetition. Bourne gets chased, throws some punches, and gets away. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Repeat to infinity.\r\n\r\nI actually felt bad for the actors having to deliver such dreadful dialogue; their onscreen characters literally describe everything that\u2019s happening as it unfolds (\u201cIt\u2019s Bourne!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot!\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s running upstairs!\u201d and \u201cThe files are downloaded!\u201d). At some point it started to get funny.\r\n\r\nMatt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and it feels like he\u2019s sleepwalking through the entire movie. Even the talented Alicia Vikander phones in her questionable performance (is she supposed to have an accent or not?) and Tommy Lee Jones plays yet another scowling caricature of a sinister government official. There\u2019s little in the way of character development and the only actor who\u2019s enjoyable here is franchise veteran Julia Stiles. What a pity that she\u2019s not given much to do.\r\n\r\nEven the action sequences are inexcusably incoherent. Paul Greengrass is one of my least favorite directors, mainly because he loves that fast cutting junk where I can\u2019t tell what is going on in the movie. It\u2019s a filmmaking style for those with short attention spans and it\u2019s a sign of extreme laziness.\r\n\r\nGreengrass sucks all the fun out of what should\u2019ve been a spectacular car chase down the Las Vegas strip. Instead of taking his time and showing off the pageantry of stunt driving with a steady hand (see the legendary cinematic car chases in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cDeath Proof,\u201d William Friedkin\u2019s \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d Peter Yates\u2019 \u201cBullit,\u201d Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cFast Five,\u201d or hell, even Michael Bay\u2019s \u201cBad Boys II\u201c), Greengrass once again opts for the lazy way out and gives us a messy commotion of three second snippets that seem to be edited together in a blender on the high setting.\r\n\r\nNone of the elements work: the film covers no new ground, it lacks any energy, and it simply feels tired, making \u201cJason Bourne\u201d the lamest of all in the series.\r\n\r\n**MATT SAYS:**\r\n\r\n\u201cConversation\u201d with 5-word sentences using spy and techno-jargon. Quick cut to person typing on computer: Beep, boop, beep. Quick cut to shaky cam conversation. Another five-word-sentence conversation and more shaky cam. Cut to shaky-cam motorcycle chase with no sense of geography. Cut back to computer.\r\n\r\nCut, cut, cut. Shaky cam, shaky cam, shaky cam. \u201cJason Bourne\u201d might as well have been shot and assembled by a seven-year-old with ADD that hasn\u2019t taken his Ritalin. It wasn\u2019t so much edited as jammed together. So little artistry went into making this movie that it\u2019s hard to even call Paul Greengrass its \u201cdirector.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of my recurring rants is on the use of quick cutting and shaky cams in action films: it\u2019s the hallmark of lazy filmmaking. When your action sequences are constructed by using cut after cut after cut, you don\u2019t have to worry about storyboarding (contrast \u201cThe Raid: Redemption\u201c). You don\u2019t need actors who have any training in fight choreography (contrast \u201cThe Raid 2\u201c). You don\u2019t have to concern yourself with geography or spatial relationships. In other words, instead of having to WORK at creating a compelling action sequence, you can hack your way through it. And boy, there is NO ONE working in film now that loves hack action better than Paul Greengrass. And nowhere has Greengrass\u2019s hackiness been on display more than in \u201cJason Bourne.\u201d It\u2019s his masterpiece of hacketry. I can continue making up new word forms using \u201chack\u201d to describe this movie and director, but I think you get the idea.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bad direction and editing, \u201cJason Bourne\u201d stinks because it\u2019s a poor excuse for a spy thriller. We are subjected to scene after scene of dreadful acting. Julia Stiles (Nicky Parsons) is the worst of the lot, but Matt Damon (Jason Bourne), Alicia Vikander (Heather Lee) and Tommy Lee Jones (Director Dewey) are only marginally better. The script is abysmal, with the characters not so much dialoguing with one another as speaking spy techno-jargon while they type on computers that are constantly beep-bloop-bleeping (no computer I\u2019ve ever used makes so many noises when scanning files). Using words that sound cool does not make a scene interesting. And the plot? It\u2019s barely even there.\r\n\r\nI found only three things enjoyable about this movie. The very first fight scene between Bourne and some nameless guy \u2014 the one you see in the trailer. The story thread featuring the Silicon Valley billionaire that refused to screw over the public in the name of national security. And the final vehicular chase scene down Las Vegas Boulevard \u2014 which I liked in spite of the terrible editing (which, incidentally, got the geography of the Strip all wrong).\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t make this movie a hit, because then we will get lots of imitators (like we did after \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d and \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201c, when quick cuts and shaky cam were used in 95% of all action pictures).\r\n\r\nDemand more for your money. There are so many movies that do it better than this one. Do you want an engaging, twisty techno-spy thriller? Check out the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d series. Do you want a well-written story of international espionage and intrigue? See \u201cOur Kind of Traitor.\u201d Do you want well-choreographed fight sequences? Watch \u201cThe Raid\u201d movies.

The two of them quickfire dialogue in true Sorkin fashion, and while _Molly's Game_ will probably not top anybody's lists for 2017, I do think most people will at the very least gain something from the movie, be it insight or enjoyment. Hopefully? Both.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

            "review": "**When two different ancient arts meet.**\r\n\r\nThis is not some film. The project was decided when two leaders of the respective nation met a couple of years ago. More like it is China's move to mend the relationship with India. So except Indian cast participation and a few Indian locations, this is completely 'made in China' and for the Chinese market. Like always any Chinese product, this is not a quality product. Just an another 'The Myth' from the same director.\r\n\r\nTeam up between India and China is a rare thing in filmdom, so I was curious about that. It should have been a star studded cast, but from the Chinese side, it does, not on the Indian side. The worst screenplay award goes for Mr. Tong. Literally, it is a retelling story of those great treasure hunt adventure films we had seen so far in our life. Even Jackie Chan could not save it. His presence failed to do the usual magic. Like his signature, action-comedy, nothing new to appreciate either his part or the film.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the famous Chinese archaeologist Jack, who teams up with his Indian counterpart for a new quest. Equipped with the modern technological tools, the crew heads for a frozen lake in the Himalayas. It's the first and an important clue for the rest of the treasure hunt. But it was interrupted by a group of armed men and soon the tale flies to Dubai, followed by Western India, where it comes to end with lots of action and adventures.\r\n\r\n> \u275d'Vastu Shastra', the oldest book ever written about architectural design.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe opening scene sets in some thousand years ago. The graphics were very poor in that part. Even computer games have much better CGI work. So I lost the interest in the film within the first sixty seconds. The stunt choreography was unbelievably terrible. I mean too much unrealistic, I felt it like I was watching some kind of commercial Tollywood/Rajamouli film. Surely this film was not made under the art and the film-making value. It seems nobody was interested to participate or make a quality film. They made it to just to keep the promise made by the politicians, so it was wrapped up awfully.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a bad combination of words for a title. Kung fu and Yoga. Like the polar opposite, two different philosophies. One is violence and the other one is peace and healthy. Though not bad how those two were utilised to tell the tale. This is a watchable film, but no good at all. Might be the worst Jackie Chan film I've ever seen. Promoting the unrealistic road projects in the film was a bad idea, and enough reason to flop in India.\r\n\r\nThere are many good actresses in India, but they have picked Disha Patani. She's a real beauty, but the performance was worse than the film's graphics. I could not stand for her dialogue deliverance. She just read them rather than expressing naturally as any actors do in the world. The end was really disappointing. An easy compromise. It's good for the real life, but not good for an entertainment film. Those who are seeking treasure hunt film, just stay away from it. Because it looks more like a parody than a distinct one. Overall the film was overwhelmed by lots bad parts. So easily a skippable film of the year, which has a big name in it.\r\n\r\n_02/10_"

When his father is shot dead by a gangster, a teenaged Sathyadev (Ajith) yearns for revenge. But, should he cross the line between good and bad? Sathyadev chooses the good side and becomes a cop. He eliminates a most wanted gangster, Matthew ( Stunt Silva), by befriending one of his henchmen, Victor (Arun Vijay). A few years later, Sathyadev is attracted to Hemanika ( Trisha), a single mother and a dancer. But when Hemanika is murdered on the eve of their wedding, Sathyadev goes on a cross-country sojourn with her six-year-old daughter Esha ( Anikha). But, five years later, situations force him to put on his cop shoes after he stumbles upon an illegal organ harvesting group that is being led by a ghost from his past \u2014 Victor. The gang's next target is Thenmozhi ( Anushka), an intrepid young woman, and Sathyadev decides to protect her at all cost. \r\n\r\nEveryone has a moment in their lives when they have to choose what they want to become and in Yennai Arindhaal, both the protagonist and antagonist get such a moment. While Sathyadev chooses to be on the right side, loses people close to him of his choice and still manages to vanquish evil, Victor refuses to cross the line that separates the bad from the good. The director underscores this element in a crucial scene where Sathyadev and Victor speak to each other over a phone. Gautham splits the screen so that we see Sathyadev on one side and Victor on the other with a fine line separating these two characters. And, suddenly, an earlier scene where Sathyadev is deciding on what to become \u2014 a cop or a gangster \u2014 feels all the more important. He would have turned into another Victor if he had chosen the latter! Not surprisingly, Moondru Mugam, a film about a fearless cop and his two sons who grow up into contrasting characters, is playing on a TV screen during this scene. \r\n\r\nThe romance segments of the film seem to be other versions of the romantic tracks we saw in Kaakha Kaakha (a bold young woman attracted to an enigmatic cop) and Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu (middle-aged cop falling in love with a single mom). That is not to say they aren't interesting. Gautham is one filmmaker who knows how to write female characters and here, Thenmozhi and Hemanika are well-rounded characters. He, in fact, begins the film with Thenmozhi's life, just to tell us what kind of woman she is, rather than begin it with her first encounter with Sathyadev. And with Hemanika, he brings out the doubts that a divorced young woman with a child would have when she is courted by a decent man. \r\n\r\nBut the film does seem less punchy than Kaakha Kaakha and Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu; it falls a bit short when it comes to matching the emotional undercurrent in the former and the detective thriller beats in the latter. The thriller elements, especially, are subdued, mainly because the director is focused more on the character study aspect and so, the first half feels less exciting. A sub-plot involving another gangster only increases the running time without adding much to the plot. But once Victor enters Sathyadev's life, Gautham changes gears and we get the cop thriller that we were expecting. Arun Vijay, despite sharing certain resemblances with Gautham's villains from the other films, manages to be effective in this role. Though, the role of Victor's wife ( Parvathy Nair) is underwritten and we are baffled when he puts himself at risk for him in the climax. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the film belongs to Ajith and the star is in such fine form here. Playing a character that gives him the chance to be someone his age, here, he turns on the charms when he is with the heroines and taps into the coolly aggressive and self-possessed persona that we saw in Mankatha and Billa. And, Gautham and cinematographer Dan Macarthur superbly capture the star's charisma and swagger (the actor sports four to five distinct looks throughout the film) that we cannot look at anyone else when he is on screen."

Directed by a first timer, it tells the true story of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson's first date back in the 1989 during working for a big law firm in Chicago. Like how Michelle denied it is a date as co-workers should not engage in a close relationship. While Obama is trying to win her heart, the film reveals their day, what they talk and do and how it all ends.\r\n\r\nThis is not a biographical film I was expecting. I mean I was looking forward to the film, but not this kind of simple story. This looks like another version of 'Before Sunrise', and I won't be surprised if they make a sequel in a similar fashion, maybe a trilogy. So this is a one day event when they were young and passionate about their work, somewhat they both liked each other, though they knew their limits. The writer-come-director confirms all the events from his film really occurred, but not all of them in just one date.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, especially I liked Parker Sawyers as Barack Obama. For me, this is not a great film, but decently made one. Obama fans might like it, though you could try it if you like date film in a realistic manner. It's Obama's early life, so there's nothing about his present politics or the president post, except talking about their future plans. But most of the film about between them and their life, like how they grew how, what they love and loved, those kind of stuffs. So I hope you watch it with a low expectation.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"

            "review": "One might nostalgically recall the days back when the cheesy yet infectious Japanese monster movies were such a magnificent draw during those hazy Saturday afternoons showcasing the double creature feature matinees that aired weekly on television. We were considered very lucky if we had Mothera battle Gamera in one showing followed up by experiencing the sheer thrill of watching Rodan take on his latest ferocious foe as well. However, as well-known as these mentioned Far East big screen beasts were in all their glorious rage and colorful destruction nobody was as legendary or instrumental in seriously wreaking havoc on vulnerable Japanese soil both heroically or horrendously than our heralded King of Carnage in the celebrated _Godzilla_. \r\n\r\nThe famed and humongous rumble-and-tumble reptile makes a grand return courtesy of Toho Studios reviving the catastrophic critter in writer/co-director Hideaki Anno\u2019s and Shinji Higuchi\u2019s monster mash offering **Godzilla Resurgence** (a.k.a.\u201dShin Godzilla\u201d). Interestingly, the last _Godzilla_ flick that was released by Toho Studios was more than a decade ago in 2004. Naturally, Japanese audiences were privileged to the exploitative antics of the favorable large lizard when **Godzilla Resurgence** premiered earlier this year.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Anno\u2019s and Higuchi\u2019s spry creature concoction is now showing up in limited release in other countries as _Godzilla_ dusts off his combative cobwebs from yesteryear and makes a contemporary return to the cinematic psyches for baby-boomers looking to revive their childhood memories of the spike-toothed rampaging rogue doing what he does best: stomping through the endangered streets of Japan in the name of high-wire popcorn entertainment. In any event, there is a willing welcome wagon to embrace this familiar and feisty monstrous menace with robust enjoyment. There have been previous _Godzilla_ editions that were not necessarily received with the pat-on-the-back reception (yes Roland Emmerich\u2013we are referencing your disastrous take on 1998\u2019s _Godzilla_). Still, **Godzilla Resurgence** accomplishes the impossible as it stays close to its humble 1954 roots while managing to sprinkle some fresh impishness within its clever manufactured mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe screening experience of viewing the majestic monster _Godzilla_ is stunning and surreal because the film\u2019s handlers create the terrorizing tension and torture of a full-scale predator crashing his way into the miniature-sized obstacles (people, buildings, bridges, power lines, etc.) with demolished durability. The physical details on the _Godzilla_ monster are hideously wondrous and every bloody drool from the creature\u2019s jagged mouth and ominous scaly skin is profoundly sinister. The thought of Godzilla\u2019s two-ton tail pouncing and waving with destructive defiance generates the additional mystique of this Asia-based destroyer.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite informed about the backstory of the _Godzilla_ mythology it is quite simple: a classical creature was born/created back in 1954 at Toho Studios where filmmaker Ishiro Honda presented a monster flick that would go on to endure as a cult favorite in Japanese cinema and elsewhere around the world for the next six decades. Sure, the various _Godzilla_ installments (not including the derivative American versions) were saddled in inspired cheesiness (you got to love the laughable \u201cman-in-the-monster-suit\u201d cheapened special effects) with toy model sets serving as a deteriorating Japanese background to _Godzilla\u2019s_ cinematic wrath. Nevertheless, the clear message was received thoughtfully and philosophically\u2013_Godzilla_ and his creepy contemporaries was conceived and symbolic of that country\u2019s disillusionment with its atomic bombing past. As a result, the Japanese-based beasts were reflective of the man-made devastation that haunted a targeted region of the world that knew annihilation and humiliation. _Godzilla_ made for some escapist thrills and chills for Japanese movie audiences in the heyday of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s but Honda\u2019s alarming predatory pest would also resonate as a freakish catalyst for the country\u2019s past and present turmoil for political, societal and technological survival. Hence, _Godzilla_ is a representative (and product) of a historical nuclear blast that remains as an immense ugly chapter in humanity.\r\n\r\n**Godzilla Resurgence** (_Shin Godzilla_) introduces good ole Godzilla as a mystery wrecking machine unbeknownst to the Tokyo city officials that have no clue in how to contain the unknown boisterous, beastly intruder as he storms through Japan like a loose sledgehammer through a light bulb factory. Once the return of the ravenous Godzilla had been identified the big brass now has to figure out how to eradicate the enormous fiendish phenomenon. Do they nuke the corrosive creature without the dire consequences of sacrificing its jeopardized citizens in the territory?\r\n\r\nAs the Japanese government agonizes over what should be done with Godzilla\u2019s dubious presence as he methodically smashes everything in his wicked path the cynicism grows moment by moment. Specifically, why is Godzilla\u2019s tumultuous existence impacting their way of life? Is the creature\u2019s overstayed welcome some sort of plot from the rest of the world to dump unrest and debauchery on their sacred grounds? Better yet can the foreign superpowers such as the United States, China or Russia collaborate to help terminate the mighty monster? Will Godzilla disturb global concerns and if so how will the militaristic mindset play out in Japan\u2019s beleaguered backyard?\r\n\r\n**Godzilla Resurgence** aims to be more than just a typical giant monster movie mired in splashy CGI special effects and engulfed explosions. Anno (\u201cEvangelion\u201d) and Higuchi (\u201cAttack on Titan\u201d) actually serve up a sophisticated and thought-provoking creature caper that digs underneath the throwaway exploitation surface. The tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is firmly maintained and the moviegoers are treated to their share of Godzilla\u2019s manic mischievousness. Importantly, Anno and Higuchi amp up their brand of a disguised political potboiler in the form of a sci-fi monster B movie that sufficiently labors at mirroring the current-day chaos and conflicts that bombard a modern-day Japan (or any inserted nation for that matter). Whether spotlighting international trust/distrust or pinpointing kaiju (meaning \u201cbig, brutal monsters\u201d) terrorism as an allegory for Japan\u2019s temporary unseen but inevitable national fallout caused by an impenetrable nature disaster it is quite revealing that **Godzilla Resurgence** delves beyond its cartoonish ruination.\r\n\r\nWhatever interpretation that one derives from **Godzilla Resurgence** the verdict is undeniably sound that Toho Studios delivers a lively and message-driven platform about uncontrollable forces and critical decisions that befall an ambivalent country undergoing in-house scrutiny. To put it in layman\u2019s terms: **Godzilla Resurgence** is a surprisingly well-done despite its sometimes campy makeup. Surely **Resurgence** is solid enough to uphold the G-man\u2019s beloved legacy in the kaiju genre.\r\n\r\n**Godzilla Resurgence (Shin Godzilla)** 2016\r\n\r\nToho Studios\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nStarring: Hiroki Hasegawa, Satomi Ishihara, Yutaka Takenouchi, Ren Ohsugi, Akira Emoto\r\n\r\nDirected by: Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi\r\n\r\nWritten by: Hideaki Anno\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: NR\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction & Fantasy/Action & Adventure/Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016"

            "review": "> While an evil force slowly possessing them, the family bond is put on a test.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the collection of a series of the real events that takes place in the 17th century New England. The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.\r\n\r\nWow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.\r\n\r\nIt was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nA simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.\r\n\r\n8/10"

Because she was amazing in the title role, I never doubted since I saw the first trailer and the movie delivered as much as I expected. The rest of the cast was also fantastic. I liked the simplicity of its storytelling.\r\n\r\nIt was a short movie. I think that was an advantage for a small theme movie like this. Don't underestimate it for its small budget, the production quality was great, but you know it's packed with predictable stuffs yet very entertaining, a slightly under-appreciated movie. It was shot within the 20 days and in the era of mega films like 'Fury Road', there are audience to acknowledge for a little flick like this. Whatever your verdict going to be I say just watch it.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of original 'American Pie', who had lots of ups and downs in his career, but most of them were low profile flicks, even though those had big names in the cast. This is one of his best, at least in the recent time. I know this is just a one-off movie, but I won't mind if the a couple of sequels follows from here. Because this is a wonderful concept, not just for fun, I consider it a slice of someone's real life.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "The pre-release buzz around Mani Ratnam's O Kadhal Kanmani was that it is a sequel to Alaipayuthey and while the maker has denied this, nonetheless, the film does feel like a spiritual cousin to the earlier film. The circumstances that led to the films couldn't have been any similar. At the time he made Alaipayuthey, Mani Ratnam had delivered a couple of films (Iruvar, Dil Se) that did not work at the box office and questions were raised on whether this avowedly mainstream filmmaker was not connecting with his audience. This time, after the failed experiments of Raavanan and Kadal, these questions are being raised yet again. \r\n\r\nAnd the filmmaker shows that his touch is in tact and he can still make a romance come alive on screen. With some help from PC Sreeram, whose gorgeous, superbly-lit frames capture the beauty of both Mumbai and the cramped quarters of the lead couple, and AR Rahman, whose hip songs and background score, keeps the scenes throbbing, Mani Ratnam has given us a romantic film for this generation. Unlike Kadal, which never came together as a whole despite some standout moments, the scenes here flow organically, and let us soak in the breezy romance between Adhi and Tara (Dulquer Salmaan and Nithya Menon, who sizzle on screen). \r\n\r\nThere are scenes that seem to mirror, as if purposefully, Alaipayuthey. As in that film, the meet-cute happens at the railway station and at a wedding. The pair woos each other on the train. Even the financial background of their families (Tara is super rich, while Adhi is a middle-class boy), and their fashionable jobs (if Alaipayuthey's Karthik was working in an IT startup and Shakti a medical student, Adhi here is a video game designer, while Tara is an architecture student) are similar. Like Shakti, Tara goes on a study tour (here, it is Ahmedabad) and like Karthik, Adhi follows his lover there. There is also an older couple as in that film informing their romance. And, there is even a search for a loved one that finally makes the lead couple realize what they actually want. \r\n\r\nBut this is a love story about youngsters from this generation, who tend to give career the same importance as relationship. So, unlike Karthik and Shakti, who couldn't wait to get married, Adhi and Tara want to be together but at the same time, realize that their relationship comes with an expiry date (much like Arjun and Meera from Ratnam's Ayitha Ezhuthu) as she will be moving to Paris for higher studies while he might go to the US or the UK to earn more money. So, they settle for a live-in relationship and stay in the house of the elderly Ganapathy ( Prakash Raj, who gives his most understated performance since his brief role in Vettaiyaadu Vilayadu) and Bhavani (Leela Samson making a spirited debut). Ganapathy is a retired bank officer and Bhavani, a classical singer whose Azheimer's is in its early stage. Their easy-going relationship is one of the highlights in the film. \r\n\r\nStill, for all its infectious vigour, crackling dialogue and youthful vibe, there are times when we sense that we are watching a film that is lacking in punch as this tale is short on conflicts. This is especially true in the second half when, after a point, the characters seem to be repeating themselves (the whole sequence when Adhi and Tara decide to enjoy their last few days to the hilt seems redundant). Too much screen time is also given to the video game that Adhi is developing (an action thriller set in Mumbai where the hero has to rescue the heroine from a two-headed villain), which feels like a script that Ratnam discarded at some point in his career. \r\n\r\nBut these are minor niggles that we need not be concerned too much about right now (but still need to be mentioned because we have come to expect so much from this director). They don't really take away much from how entertaining the film is, and more importantly, this is the time for us to celebrate a return-to-form of one of our premier filmmakers."

That's partially true, because this was inspired by the right kind of wrong thing. I mean it was not actually about the McDonalds' story, the McDonald brothers, but the fast food chain McDonald, how the franchise got rapidly spread across the globe and the person behind it. With the film having both good and bad side, it stayed mostly neutral. But due to the main character, you would see too much lean on what seems the reason behind the McDonald's today's popularity.\r\n\r\nSo it's like another typical American founders' story like Apple, Facebook. I mean not the one who found the company with all the hard works, but the one who dived in and took all the credit. Ray Kroc was a traveling salesman and he's not doing any good. But one day he meets the brothers who had started a modernised kitchen and its fast food service. He shows lots of interest in it and so he joins hands with them. With his new ideas, how he makes a fortune out of it and the future of the company, all revealed in the later part.\r\n\r\nAn enjoyable film. Particularly for Michael Keaton. Well directed film as well. Film wise it was a good one, but the story wise not morally right. It was about the flaws in our society, our system. Some men can do anything like pulling others leg to climb the success ladder. It's not them to blame completely, because they had struggled enough to understand their future path. So definitely for some people, this film would inspire. If you are a regular McDonalds' customer, you should watch it. Otherwise, just to learn the truth, it is worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

So a young woman who worked hard to get a job in a leading tech company, starts her life anew. At one end, aged and seriously ill parents, and the other end, making an unexpected leap in the workplace lead her to be a celebrity overnight. But it's only going to change her life forever, but how is to know, one must watch the film.\r\n\r\nIt was an Emma Watson's film. Tom Hanks was is an important role, but Watson led the show. Nice theme, but predictable storyline. I indeed guessed the end, which spoiled my watch. Slightly an awareness film too. Not all the technology can make life better, but sometimes opposite. Particularly, the film highlighted the privacy issue, how important it is for everyone. And at a same time, transparency too can bring a major change in society. But it all depends on the people and their professions. Surely not to be missed, despite you enjoy it or dislike it.\r\n\r\n**6/10**"

            "review": "Every once in a while there is family-friendly entertainment that lives up to its wonderment in imaginative storytelling and stunning visual scope. Certainly this is the case with the stimulating yet meditative Japanese animated fantasy-adventure **Kubo and the Two Strings**. Undeniably vibrant and philosophical in committed heart and soul, **Kubo and the Two Strings** is a majestic masterpiece in its colorfully realized presentation that ambitiously binds together opulent elements of ancient Far East folklore, eye-opening anime and origami (the finesse art of paper-folding). The competition for jaw-dropping animation within recent years (or even this year) has been remarkably stellar thus far but Kubo confirms its superiority above the ranks. No one can doubt the masterful film-making technique administered by the film\u2019s director Travis Knight in this glossy, whimsical medieval gem.\r\n\r\nAs with the majority of adventurous and challenging narratives that seek the high-minded exploratory vibes in its execution, **Kubo and the Two Strings** is about the creative coming-of-age quest of a young boy and the spellbinding encounters that materialize as a result. Knight and screenwriters Marc Haimes and Chris Butler oversees a profound and aesthetically remarkable production highlighted by notable voiceover performers (such as Academy Award-winners Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey), stylish and glowing animation and a hypnotic showcase that is an exquisite treat for moviegoers from all walks of life.\r\n\r\nImportantly,** Kubo and the Two Strings** is aided by its heralded association with the Oregon-based studio Laika whose treasured reputation in the stop-motion animation process is tremendously noteworthy. Among Laika\u2019s previously outstanding cinematic samples include 2009\u2019s _Coraline_, 2011\u2019s criminally underrated _ParaNorman_ and 2014\u2019s _The Boxtrolls_ so indeed Knight\u2019s superlative **Kubo and the Two Strings** is among exceptional stock. The detailed imagery in **Kubo** is indescribably luscious and the brilliant artistic manufacturing of Laika\u2019s refined flourishes only elevates Knight\u2019s enticing animated vehicle as a compelling journey into the ancient Japanese Edo period mythology.\r\n\r\nOne can tell that the coveted **Kubo and the Two Strings** is destined to stay true to its mystical leanings especially when the beginning film\u2019s sequence features the caustic quote: \u201c\u201cIf you must blink, do it now\u201d \u2026because \u201cif you look away, even for an instant, our hero will surely perish.\u201d As previously mentioned the story takes place in ancient Japan where we find the gifted 11-year old Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) existing with his ailing mother on the outskirts of a nearby village. The young Kubo\u2019s talents is such that he is a natural story-telling magician that can skillfully convey his expressive communication through origami. Kubo enjoys the gesture of entertaining the local villagers. However, his mother advises that Kubo must be home before nightfall. Unfortunately, Kubo does not heed her advice but that is not due to his personal defiance or negligence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Kubo\u2019s no-show at home is large in part cue to the dubious agenda of his grandfather Moon Father (Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes). In instructing his dastardly daughters to track down their beleaguered nephew the stakes are high especially when Moon Father was instrumental in the demise of his slain samurai father. Hence, Kubo must locate his late father\u2019s magical armor-related belongings and reclaim a sense of honor. The tag-a-longs at Kubo\u2019s side include the woolly-looking snow Monkey (Theron) and buff warrior Beetle (McConaughey). Together, the travelling trio is confronted by beastly specimens and other deceptive supernatural forces en route to the ultimate showdown with his sinister grandfather Moon Father. Armed with resiliency and determination Kubo and his crafty companions face uncertainties that are quite unimaginable to say the least.\r\n\r\n**Kubo and the Two Strings** is an astonishing offering that taps into its pulsating pulse with its mild intensity that should not deter the youngsters from fully experiencing the escapist vision of young Kubo and his offbeat sidekicks. Parkinson\u2019s Kubo is idealistic and has a fearless approach to questioning the unassuming world around him. The combination of roguishness and wide-eyed innocence is certainly appealing to the intrigued tots that may view Kubo\u2019s wily exploits as exciting and surreal in the name of his heroic daddy\u2019s destiny. Theron\u2019s acid-tongued Monkey is inspired in grand impishness with snarky flair. As for McConaughey\u2019s flippant gung-ho Beetle he is an odd serving of comical relief and well-intentional courageousness. Fiennes makes for an ideal unctuous rival as his Moon Father is the Darth Vader to Kubo\u2019s impressionable Luke Skywalker blueprint. Also, Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara is wickedly delicious as the scheming aunts\u2013the twin sisters of Kubo\u2019s sickly mother. Rounding out the supporting cast are the supplied voices of Asian contributors such as George Takei\u2019s (\u201cTV Star Trek\u2019s original Sulu\u201d) Hosato, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa\u2019s Hashi and Minae Noji\u2019s Minae among the Kubo personalities that populate Knight\u2019s dazzling display of a transcendent Japanese-flavored Grimm fairy tale.\r\n\r\nNaturally the real selling point for **Kubo and the Two Strings** is the standout computer-generated technology and other incorporated genres of animation that gives this polished fantasy fable its magnificent sheen. Knight, a first-time director whose background as Laika\u2019s primary animator is evidenced in the celebrated animation studio\u2019s first three films, demonstrates the authenticity of his amazing craft courtesy of the stop-motion precision that defines his sensual cinematic landscape.\r\n\r\nOverall, **Kubo and the Two Strings** radiates with sweeping charm, boldness, curiosity and depth as it exemplifies the epitome of the awestruck construction of an enlightening, sophisticated feature length animation. The mixture of humor, thrills, drama and tragedy is decidedly triumphant allowing **Kubo and the Two Strings** to flex its reflective, throbbing mysterious muscles.\r\n\r\n**Kubo and the Two Strings** (2016)\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr. 41 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Brenda Vaccaro\r\n\r\nDirected by: Travis Knight\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Fantasy & Sci-Fi/ Action & Adventure/Animation\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: **** stars (out of 4)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016"

            "review": "**In the erstwhile onscreen battle between good and evil, the heroes always win, managing to overpower the diabolical, powerful villain.**\r\n\r\nWe all know that and we\u2019ve seen it in movies umpteen times. Question is, would we like to see it again, in Pakistan\u2019s first-ever animated venture, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Waadi Animations\u2019 3 Bahadur?\r\n\r\n**For anybody who loves a good, well-told story, the answer would have to be yes, the crowd that gathered for the film's Karachi premiere seemed to agree.**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crux behind 3 Bahadur may be the age-old fight between good and evil, but the plot itself has been twisted, tweaked and peppered with humor, song and action so that it does not appear hackneyed. Cleverly molded, carefully constructed and candy-wrapped in fluent Urdu dialogues, this movie\u2019s an entertainer not just for the kids, but also for the grown-ups snickering beside them.\r\n\r\n\r\n**In 3 Bahadur, Kamil, Saadi and Amna are three \u2018bahadur\u2019 children who decide to take on the evil goon \u2018Mangu\u2019 and put an end to his reign of terror. \u2018Mangu\u2019 is aided by evil powers given to him by Baba Baalam and assisting him is a band of no-good, despicable hoodlums. Together, they wreak havoc over the imaginary city of \u2018Roshan Basti\u2019, looting and killing until the once-happy locality is re-named \u2018Andher Nagri\u2019.**\r\n\r\nWhat happens next is inevitable.\r\n\r\n**Our heroes\u2019 valor induces them to gain supernatural powers of their own and they proceed to quell the bad guys in a series of often hilarious, action-packed sequences. Predictable? Undeniably. But what makes this movie work are the nuances within. A gigantic thug who practices classical dance for recreation will make you laugh; the children\u2019s repartee is entertaining and the parents\u2019 angst as the heroes march off to overthrow Mangu adds for sentimental value. The voice-overs are spot-on and character development is limited but interesting enough, as the children transform from ordinary school-pupils to superheroes for their long-suffering town.**\r\n\r\nThe movie, however, cannot really be seen for its animation.\r\n\r\n**We\u2019ve seen plenty of Hollywood\u2019s 3D imagery to appreciate the flawless, almost-lifelike technology employed by Disney or Pixar. Pakistan\u2019s first-ever venture into animation can\u2019t, and doesn't, compare.**\r\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 movements are stilted and the visuals are not very pleasing. However, Hollywood works with big budgets and has honed its animation through years of research and development. We still have a long way to go.\r\n\r\n**However, the same local audience that consistently watches Hollywood\u2019s animated treats is bound to be regaled by 3 Bahadur.**\r\n\r\nThe villains in 3 Bahadur.\r\n\r\n**The villains in 3 Bahadur.\r\nFor the creators may flounder as they take their initial steps into animation but they make up for it with a catchy soundtrack and a plot that keeps audiences gripped for the entire 90-minute duration of the movie.**\r\n\r\n\r\n**The story of the '3 Bahadurs' opens with the bright, blithe, buoyant 'Raunaqein'\r\nAlso read: 3 Bahadur's new song Raunaqein is full of life.**\r\n\r\nThe mobile-snatching, pilfering, money-laundering and water shortage suffered by Andher Basti at the hands of Mangu are all-too-familiar, echoing the **lawlessness of present-day Karachi.**\r\n\r\nCase in point: the thugs discuss with each other, \u201cLogon ko mamooli maslon mein uljha do toh unhein bari baton ka pata nahin chalta\u201d (\u201cKeep the people busy with everyday problems so that they don\u2019t realize the bigger crimes being committed.\u201d). The underlying message beyond the basic story rings loud and clear: it\u2019s time that our nation looks beyond daily grievances, realizes the bigger issues at hand and gathers the courage to overpower the \u2018Mangus\u2019 surrounding them.\r\n\r\n**3 Bahadur's dialogues in fluent Urdu are another plus. Certain recent local movies have incorporated far too much English into their scripts, alienating a large chunk of cinema-goers. 3 Bahadur is in Urdu and is proud of it; its witticisms and messages are for the nation as a whole and not just the anglicized upper classes.**\r\n\r\nThis movie is, of course, preceded by a great deal of pre-release promotions. Masked 3 Bahadur characters have already made the rounds in local schools, distributing coloring books and T-shirts at times; there\u2019s a smartphone game based on the movie already available for download and the movie\u2019s perpetually being featured in TV ads.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sharmeen herself has been making television appearances here, there and everywhere; on morning shows and even evening game shows where people come to 'jeeto\u2019 motorbikes and ingots of gold. The publicity has generated enough curiosity about the movie to guarantee a strong opening crowd. Chances are, it\u2019ll later attract in more people based on its own merit.**\r\n\r\nThe one, most glaring error in the movie is the way sponsors feature in almost every scene. It\u2019s understandable that movie-making is an expensive business and it\u2019s great that so many sponsors came on board to support 3 Bahadur. But did certain biscuit brands have to be placed in every shot? And is it so important to stress upon that one soap brand?\r\n\r\n**Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, as our Oscar-winner, has a credible name even though this may be her debut into animated movies. Having their names on the movie\u2019s poster and billboards should be sufficient for the sponsors. The perpetual advertising grates on the nerves and brings down the entertainment value of an otherwise riveting storyline.**\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the movie\u2019s worth a watch: for Sharmeen\u2019s intelligent transition from ace documentary-maker to pioneering animation in local cinema; for the messages it gives out; for the laughs and the action. It sets the groundwork for better animation in the future and promotes \u2018bahaduri\u2019 in order to ensure a stronger, better Pakistan. That\u2019s a message we can\u2019t ever tire of."

There is bad audio, continuity errors, hammy dialogue, some very bizarre choices in cinematography and the occasional scene of poor acting.\r\n\r\nThe story however (while following a fairly predictable family-friendly line) is totally engrossing. Chess may not be the most engaging spectator sport, but the journey of lead-character Phiona is a thorough one, and an intriguing side-step away from the usual Disney setting.\r\n\r\nDavid Oyelowo is particularly worth looking out for. He (unsurprisingly) gives a fantastic performance.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._"

            "review": "**All for Norway.**\r\n\r\nIt is from the director of 'A Thousand Times Good Night'. This movie is like the Norwegian version of the Academy Awards winner 'The King's Speech'. Likewise, it was based on the real, that happened around the same timeline of the history, id est, the World War II. Except matching title, it was totally a different narrative. When the Germany was expecting a response to their demand, the Norway cabinet made most of the decisions and turned it down to remain independent country. But from all, a decision that made by the king is what this film was based on and how it changed the Norway's fate was depicted.\r\n\r\nThis film was sent to the 2017 Oscars, unfortunately it did not advance to the main event. They might have expected recognition similar to the British film. But I think both the films were good in their own way with the kind of story they told us that took place in the backdrop of the most terrible time of the recent human history. So having a similar title name justifies. It is a biopic, but the story was covered from different angles to reveal us what happened on the other side, including one of the young soldiers who fought in that war.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with the April 1940, while the Nazi army sailing towards Norway and after losing most of the cities to them, the people fled to safer places. That did not spare the Norwegian cabinet members, as well as the king Haakon VII and his family. In those hard times, he kept the nation united by respecting to how the government decided to deal with the situation.\r\n\r\nBut on one occasion, through a German diplomat with a one-time offer directly from Adolf Hitler leave the king to make the crucial decision for his nation and its people. That's the part of the film to define its title. So everything leads to that moment, how he reacts and what follows decides the Norway's fate to stand on what side of the ongoing war.\r\n\r\n> \"If I am the last card in the deck, so be it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a well made film. Neither too violent nor avoided the war depictions to turn it more drama type. Everything had its share, including those war atmosphere for such budget was impressive. More like it was a running and chasing theme. But in the initial parts, there were too many timelines mentioned about what happened on when. Details like that are really good, though I felt it was too much to take on, especially for a foreign film.\r\n\r\nOnce the tale enters the mid section, looked all were in order and also got very interesting than before. In a cold country like Norway, in those situations you are like in a multifold trouble. I mean from the common man's perspective. An army is chasing you and harsh winter, surviving that is very challenging.\r\n\r\nAll the actors were great, but the king steals the show. If this was an American film that had taken place in America, then he would have won the Oscars. The fresh undertaking films on the World War II themes would never go fade away. So this is one of the best in that kind in the recent time. Except the opening, I did not have any trouble following it. Even the 130 minutes looked shortened. But I won't think everybody would feel the same way as I did. Like any WWII films, it is a must see, particularly to learn from the Norway's perspective of the war.\r\n\r\nBut this was depicted from the early stage of the war. And since it was majorly focused from the king's perspective, being a first king elected by his people, how he had faced it, following his crucial decision leads the way to the film's conclusion. If you are as war film fan, particularly the WWII, the actual best part begins henceforth which I'm hoping for a sequel to focus on. If you are not anticipating like the top WWII films you have seen, it can be picked for a watch. But anyway, I would recommend it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

            "review": "> Adventurous,  funny, thrilling and shocking!\r\n\r\nThe second movie for me from this director after a beautiful child custody dramedy, 'Everybody in Our Family'. This was totally different, a historical theme that takes place 200 years early to the present. This is a black and white flick that perfectly blends with the timeline of the narration. The Romania's submission for the 2016's Oscars. I have not seen all the foreign movie nominees, but having seen the out of the contest films like this and Brasil's 'The Second Mother', they are a lot better than the actually in the race film, 'A War'.\r\n\r\nComing to this movie, I was almost certain that I wasn't going to write a review after knowing about it through the trailer and the synopsis despite good ratings and praised by the critics. Because I felt this must be a boring kind, so was thinking to get over with it. Like there's a saying, don't judge a book by its cover, it happened right here for me with this movie. So this is where I realised after the watch that the Academy Awards was totally wrong for snubbing it. In fact, this was one of the best foreign movies I have seen in the last six months or so.\r\n\r\n> \"When a wise man opens his mouth, open your ear.\"\r\n\r\nThey might have had a solid reason for that, that I don't know, but my guess is the film's ending. The opening was slow, the dialogues were loud, but sometime foolishly funny and sometimes wisely funny. Overall you must pay close attention, so that you can enjoy jokes. Definitely a wonderful adventure, like any other man hunt films, this was so serious on that affair, but viewers won't realise that till the final scene. A well supported music throughout to tell an incredible tale about two men on the mission who meet different people, land, culture and language.\r\n\r\nIt is 1835, in the Eastern Europe region, Wallachia, the father-son duo from the police force on a trail to track down a runaway slave. They must go beyond their territorial limits to find him. On their way, they came forwards to the people they just met needed help, and vice versa, After the intense search they grab him in the remote place, but his version of the story to flee differs. So what comes later is the final act and a very shocking conclusion.\r\n\r\n> \"Fear is shameful, but healthy. It's God's gift.\"\r\n\r\nNot so interested to very into it is something that I was not expected. The reason was obvious it was funnier than I thought. Besides that, I was uncomfortable with the slavery theme. It's turning me off from having a good time and beginning to concern. But that's how the old world was, as it was based on the old documents and texts of the real event. After that horrifying finale, the bold statement from the father to son that goes like this 'God, even looks after worms and we can't look after each other' is what made me think we had come a long way since, yet do everything has changed now? And you know the answer to that.\r\n\r\nIt was not an unusual storyline, I have seen hundreds of other similar films, but it was from the different country, hence different language, culture, comedies, landscapes and different outcome result. Well, this film gets you at with the different moods at the different level of the narration. A fine merges of multiple genre, and yet delivers more than you anticipating. If you are wondering what is the meaning of the title, 'Well Done' or 'Bravo' is the English translation.\r\n\r\nLow budget movie? But, that's the reason this movie makes a very interesting. Because the 19th century tale and this film that kind feels like made in the early 30s (except the high framerate) pretty unlike to any modern black and white films. Definitely a must see if you're interested in this year's Oscar nominees for the best foreign movies, even though it did not make.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd/10"

            "review": "Is it safe to assume that the flea-bitten feline fantasy **Nine Lives** has completely gone to the dogs? Do not let this cockeyed kiddie comedy fool you because despite its intentional cuteness involving a self-deprecating, wise-cracking wealthy businessman-turned-hedonistic hairball may be appealing to the Romper Room crowd **Nine Lives** has all the comical chops of juggling chunky kitty litter. Charmless, insipid and trivial, this juvenile clawed and clumsy caper showcasing cheesy-minded whimsy about a hybrid self-absorbed big bucks blowhard/adorable pesky pussycat and the lead little gal enjoying the mystical mayhem at large may lower the IQs for the tot-friendly audience it looks to cater to with cheap, cloying chuckles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ragging on a fetid fluff fable as **Nine Lives** is probably as blasphemous as kicking a twitchy-nosed bunny in its precious tummy. The question remains, however, if the bunny initially deserved that harsh kick? It boggles the mind as to what notable names are attached to this toothless, ticklish project. Director Barry Sonnenfeld, the heralded puppeteer behind hits such as _Men in Black_ and _Get Shorty_, inexplicably tries to breathe loony life into this stillborn catty concoction of recycled sight gags, and sugary sentimentality. Still, the manufactured roguishness and obviousness of the lightweight high jinks will have one pawing for something more, er\u2026purrrrr-cisely appetizing. In addition to Sonnenfeld\u2019s mediocre directorial efforts behind the camera, the real curiosity is how two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey signed on the dotted line to partake in this catnip-laced catastrophe. Amazingly, **Nine Lives** not only boasts one Academy Award winner in the aforementioned Spacey but two with the inclusion of the ubiquitous off-the-wall Christopher Walken. The only true sympathetic victim subjected to this tepid tail-wagging tease is the helpless cat forced to carry this Disney-esque dud on its poor furry shoulders.\r\n\r\nNoticeably, **Nine Lives** tries to be slick in tackling (or loosely exploiting) the current phenomenon of two separate entities: the popularity of the countless infectious YouTube online cat videos that aim to soothingly please the masses and the satirical profiling of controversial 2016 American presidential hopeful Donald J. Trump (through Spacey\u2019s callous characterization). Granted **Nine Lives** has its occasional brushes with welcomed impishness but for the most part this nutty narrative pussyfoots around in a total lackluster whimper.\r\n\r\nSpacey plays a megalomaniac multi-millionaire New York City-based real estate developer named Tom Brand whose specialty in spouting stylish skyscrapers within his congested urban landscape keeps him hungry for more success and business-minded progression. The problem is that Brand\u2019s workload often interferes with spending quality time (or any time for that matter) with second wife Lara (Jennifer Garner in a throwaway role) and impressionable daughter Rebecca (Malina Weissman). Clearly, Brand\u2019s neglect of his loved ones is inexcusable but the boorish tycoon does care for his offspring Rebecca although his tendency to stomp on his employees and rivals comes second nature for him. Nevertheless, Brand wants to ensure that his Rebecca receives a special upcoming 11th birthday gift to remember. After all, she is Daddy\u2019s little princess.\r\n\r\nRebecca happens to be an insane cat lover. Tom, on the other hand, cannot stomach the four-legged cuddly critters. So Brand has no choice but to satisfy his darling\u2019s wishes as he bites the bullet and visits a questionable pet store operated by creepy Felix Perkins (a seemingly disinterested Christopher Walken). Brand dutifully purchases a striking-looking tomcat named Mr. Fuzzypants for Rebecca to relish as her prized present. Suddenly through a convoluted \u201caccident\u201d criminally wealthy Tom Brand becomes comatose. Additionally, he is transported inside the hairy-coated body of Mr. Fuzzypants. And there you have it\u2013Rebecca\u2019s ultimate wish for the ideal birthday gift as having her absent Daddy Dearest Tom and beloved pet cat Mr. Fuzzypants rolled into a 2-for-1 sale package for her to treasure.\r\n\r\nAside from the predictable puns, lame and cutesy dialogue and by-the-numbers sophomoric bits **Nine Lives** drags and feels as relentlessly ragged as a victimized toy mouse at the mercy of an inner city neighborhood feral tabby. Painfully witless and wooden there is not much for the on-screen participants to do in this flea collar farce other than to play second fiddle to the synthetic exploits of the Spacey-voiced CGI domesticated bushy-tailed beast. Sure, it is easy to dismiss **Nine Lives** as mindless entertainment for the indiscriminate rug rats looking for child-like escapism. The youngsters (or oldsters for that matter) are better off chuckling at the mini funny feline features on the Internet as opposed to tolerating this fledgling fantasy about profit-making papas becoming humbled by the outer-body experience of a playfully turbulent tomcat in order to appreciate what his true and genuine riches are at hand\u2013the foundation of family. It is actually a rather nice message to promote for the kids but it is woefully undermined by the forgettable goofiness that persists in this comedic cat-box.\r\n\r\nSpacey\u2019s Trump-inspired business-minded blowhard Brand is something that could have been rejoiced in another forum if it was not lazily trapped inside this pointless kid-friendly spectacle. The iconic presence of Walken as the resident eccentric cat whisperer is wasted and forgettable. The ones you truly feel sorry for in this merry-minded mess is the doomed duo of Weissman\u2019s Rebecca and her cat cohort Mr. Fuzzypants as they try to capture the childish spirit. Sadly the adult participants in **Nine Lives** need to have their SAG cards revoked. Not since 1993\u2019s _Look Who\u2019s Talking Now_ has voiceover critters been so relentlessly annoying.\r\n\r\nThe 87-minute **Nine Lives** feels like it equally drained the single life out of Mr. Fuzzypants and more important\u2013the movie ticket buyers.\r\n\r\n**Nine Lives** (2016)\r\n\r\nEuropaCorp\r\n\r\n1 hr. 27 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, Christopher Walken, Malina Weissman, Teddy Sears, Talitha Bateman, Mark Consuelos, Robbie Amell, Cheryl Hines\r\n\r\nDirected by: Barry Sonnenfeld\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy/Fantasy & Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016"

            "review": "The year is 1979 and Dorothea Fields finds herself in her 50s raising a teenage boy, Jaime, while running a house in Santa Barbara that is always going through renovations. Jaime\u2019s father is not in the picture but who needs a father when your mother rents rooms to a handful of particular individuals ranging from different generations.  Director Mike Mills casts three powerful actresses, Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning, to fill the roles of the different women in Jaime\u2019s life and they help create three compelling female characters that pulls you in. The problem? These three exceptional characters are subsided for a coming-of-age narrative that fails to compare to the women that help raised it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Set in Santa Barbara, the film follows Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening), a determined single mother in her mid-50s who is raising her adolescent son, Jamie (newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann, in a breakout performance) at a moment brimming with cultural change and rebellion. Dorothea enlists the help of two younger women in Jamie's upbringing - via Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a free-spirited punk artist living as a boarder in the Fields' home, and Julie (Elle Fanning), a savvy and provocative teenage neighbor.\r\n\r\nBeing a single parent is tough, it is even tougher when your son is a teenager dealing with romances, the freeing energy of punk music and playing games which entails panting real hard while someone pulls on their diaphragm. After a trip to the hospital, Annette Bening\u2019s Dorothea realizes she might not be able to raise her son by herself and requests the aide of the different women in Jaime\u2019s life. Dorothea does not need help with the physical needs of raising a child in providing shelter and nutrition but the psychological needs of raising in a child in providing the knowledge about life, women and what it means to be a man. Each female was born in a different generation and dealing with their own issues that life has handed them and this leads to Jaime becoming that much more confused about life.\r\n\r\nAnnette Bening is absolutely fantastic as Dorothea and you grow a connection with her because Dorothea isn\u2019t developed as a motherly character but as a human. It isn\u2019t all Dorothea\u2019s fault as she was raised during the Depression as Jaime loves to points out. She put a barrier around her and her son when his father left and this is shown through her moments of conservatisms despite being a free spirit of sorts. She tasks these females with a job that she should be doing but that doesn\u2019t mean she is taking a step from the spotlight. She joins them to a trip to a punk rock club so she could not only understand her son but these females as well.\r\n\r\nThe first to tackle the challenge of raising Jaime is Greta Gerwig\u2019s Abbie who is influenced by feminism, punk music and photography. Abbie uses the first two influences to help guide Jaime into an understanding of what it means to be a man. As titles such as Our Bodies, Our Selves and Sisterhood is Powerful find a way onto Jaime\u2019s lap and words such as clitoris stimulation and menstruating find a way into Jaime\u2019s ears, Abbie\u2019s attempts to help Jaime define what a man is by allowing herself define herself through a the perceptive of past males in her life.\r\n\r\nThis is a trend that could be found in all three women as Ellie Fanning\u2019s Julie uses her promiscuity to rebel against her therapist mother and the world. Ellie, who is closest to Jaime\u2019s age, is the last one to tackle the task given to her and if she wasn\u2019t already sneaking into Jaime\u2019s bed every night, she probably would have avoided the task altogether. Jaime yearns for Ellie and she informs him that he just wants the idea of her. Jaime is confused, after all he is a teenage boy, and all the hormones and feminist literature is not helping.\r\n\r\nThe definition of what a man and woman is changes every generation. My great grandfather would tell me that a man buys a woman flowers, write her love letters and a bunch of other things males in 2016 no longer consider tasks a man does. Three different females are attempting to define these terms through the scope of their generation and how their generation saw it and unfortunately, majority of those definitions are no longer validated for Jaime\u2019s generation.\r\n\r\n20th Century Women takes things one step further and gives us backstories and what is to come of everyone living within the house. There is no real problem with this except for the fact that these backstories don't offer any real reflection which adds to the frustration that the film does not have an arc, well not one I could point out. At one point, I thought the film was concluding as we learn what is to come of Dorothea early on. I was later surprised that there was still an hour left within the film. Dabbled with nostalgia, 20th Century Women would have made for a better coming-of-age if the film decided to follow our titular women than just a boy that connected the three together."

This is a crime-thriller-drama sets in the early 80s, Argentina, when democracy was restored in the nation. Focused on to tell a story of a middle class family called Puccios. It's a big family, but what they did were inhumane thing. Kidnapping people for ransom money, but in the end, there's no smooth trade off. How long they go for it and how it all ends comes in the latter parts.\r\n\r\nIt was the Argentina's entry to the last year's Oscars. That's really a worst decision ever. Also it the highest grossed film in the domestic circuit. No doubt the film was well made, especially the director who also managed well with the screenplay. This film can be watched to know the truth and nothing else, because of the negative message it carries. Nearly 100 minutes long, full of dark atmosphere, but among it there was a little romance. The actors did good, despite they were in the negative roles.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of films with the dark tone, which are very enjoyable despite the film characters involved in the wrongful acts. Sometimes we root for them, it might be a robbery or a revenge theme. But there comes a time when I hesitate to encourage such films, mainly because of its serious portrayal. Makes me to think only sick people would enjoy such films. It happened recently for a Chilean film 'The Club' that I felt disgust.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the filmmaking, but I feel this better should have been a documentary film. Anyway, that's my view. It was one side narration, covered everything from the family angle. But if it was told how the cops or the victim families coped would have made totally a different film. Then I might have liked it. So overall this film was okay, I'm not in its favor though.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

Dark humor abounds,\r\nbullets rip through head and bodies, and Wick is unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThis film should be held as the gold standard for action movies. There is very little camera shake during fights and Reeves clearly has spent a lot of time preparing for this role. You can see nearly every take-down, every gunshot, and Wick has to reload at inconvenient times in a realistic fashion which also adds to the hilarity of the following kills.\r\n\r\nOverall the acting performances were solid. Reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none. I felt the villain was a bit on the weak side though, but he did his role justice. Ian McShane's character remains the strongest especially combined with the last film.\r\n\r\nThe lighting is superb! There's a red-blue theme that is in nearly every nightclub and darkly lit areas and its absolutely lovely to look at. Overall cinematography is very good.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth seeing!"

I thought only people are reacting negatively, it could be much better than the previous one, but this is really a crap. I'm as a film fanatic hate myself to criticise a film like a film critic does, but there is no other option. I don't know who are the target audience, because it was too sexy for teens and definitely adults won't enjoy unless they are similar to what in the film depicted.\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but I disliked all film with Zac Efron in it. Beside, I'm disappointed in Chloe Grace joining this team. A bad decision, she will regret doing it in the future, maybe she's already. Regarding Seth and Byrne, I don't blame them doing this, at least theirs part were much better than the others. Yet there is no laughs, the film ran with totally dry. Maybe the youngsters would enjoy it than anybody else, because I'm sure the grown-up have already seen better ones in the similar style in the 80s and 90s.\r\n\r\nI hope this is it, no more sequels. Particularly not to end up like 'American Pie', but nobody can stop that if B filmmakers take over from here on. At least first film was much better compared between these two. If you are an adult, sure you should skip it. Zac and Chloe won the Teen Choice awards, so now you know who should watch it. No offense to those who liked it, but for me it is one of the top five worst films of the year. I never write the reviews like this, but I feel bad for what this film made me to do.\r\n\r\n_3/10_"
