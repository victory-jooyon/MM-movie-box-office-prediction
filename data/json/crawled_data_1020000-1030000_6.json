Surprisingly the film was much better than I anticipation. This is a biographical-sport film and very inspiring. The story of a British boy in the early 70s who dreamt to be an Olympian, but the problem is he has not found his sports. By the time in his 20s, he finally finds his interest and gives his best to make his long pending wish to come true. The remaining narration reveals his journey to the world's one of the big events where he aims to soar like an eagle.\r\n\r\nHugh Jackman was not any terrific, he was awesome like usual, but in a supporting role. I think Taron Egerton will be the next British sensation. This film worth seeing for his phenomenal act. The real Eddie too appreciated that. The whole film revolved around these two characters and I think making it a comedy worked out so well. Nicely shot film in the beautiful places, especially those risky ski jump stunts were excellent and the direction was undoubtedly the best.\r\n\r\nThis film is not particularly about the sport, it is about one showing his passion towards his undertaking. Eddie can be seen as a role model, no matter what he achieved, his fighting spirit is motivating. I think the youngsters should watch it, especially those who are after their dreams. Not just sport persons, but any field persons. I don't know about the repeat viewing, but watching once is enough for the confidence uplift. One of the must see film of the 2016.\r\n\r\n8/10"
