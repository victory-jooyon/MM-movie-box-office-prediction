            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, especially when it involves alien invasions of some kind, movies like this always leave me excited. It doesn\u2019t matter what the audience or critics have been saying (in fact, it never does) because it won\u2019t affect my enthusiasm (in fact, nothing does). By knowing who the cast, director, writers, and producers are, I instantly know how high or low I need to set my expectations. Having this in mind, I was hoping that Captive State could be one of 2019\u2019s surprises. It has an unusual concept that can provide a very unique story if it\u2019s well-told, so the big question is: did they execute all of their ideas successfully?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no. Not even close. Honestly, the screenplay is so convoluted and messy that I felt \u201clost\u201d several times. I admire the amount of work that they put into this because they actually did and it shows. The overall concept and its ramifications are all there, the story is indeed interesting. It\u2019s just the way that it\u2019s told that ruins the entire thing. However, the first sentence I heard after the film\u2019s conclusion, came from someone who said: \u201chere I was expecting massive action and \u2026\u201d If you go into your movie theater expecting a straightforward, action-heavy, alien-invasion-type flick and you leave disappointed, that\u2019s on you! From the trailers to its marketing, there was never a message of \u201chey, this is pure action, humans vs. aliens!\u201d \r\n\r\nIt tried its best to give the world a different take on this \u201csub-genre\u201d, let\u2019s call it that. I mean, they had it all: a good cast with the always astonishing John Goodman (William Mulligan) as one of the protagonists, beautiful visual effects that elevated the set design, and the aliens actually have an intriguing physical shape. Sadly, there\u2019s barely any aliens throughout the runtime. There\u2019s hardly \u2026 anything. I don\u2019t know what happened post-production, but it feels like they were pushed to deliver something different, so they cut all of the other scenes with extra-terrestrial stuff (I\u2019m certain that they had more to show).\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is that you can never have a 100% ambiguous story. Arrival is probably the best non-typical alien-invasion movie ever, not because it scarcely shows any aliens or action, but due to its twistful and thought-provoking script. Nevertheless, it still shows a lot! You don\u2019t leave that film disappointed because you didn\u2019t see the inside of a spaceship or an actual alien. You leave perplexed and with your mind blown. Captive State just leaves you confused and wishing for more. A lot more. There\u2019s really not that much more to say on this review without getting into spoiler territory.\r\n\r\nSadly, this is one of those movies that come out every year showing tremendous potential, an innovative and intriguing premise, but that in the end, it just isn\u2019t able to succeed. It doesn\u2019t structure its story and ideas in the most efficient way possible. Its execution is sloppy, filled with hollow characters, no real flow (it feels like it\u2019s just a scene after another scene), too vague, and it profoundly hopes that you didn\u2019t figure out a pretty obvious twist so they can shock you seconds away from the end. It\u2019s not horrible, but it\u2019s definitely frustrating and disappointing.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman delivers a great performance as always, and the visual effects are striking, to say the least. The production quality is undeniable, they really worked hard to provide the audience with an environment that actually feels real. The first act is pretty good, but it\u2019s downhill from there. Ashton Sanders shares the lead with Goodman, and he\u2019s also pretty good, no doubt about it. However, and this sums up the film pretty well: if I have to check online what the name of the main character was (Gabriel Drummond), then something went terribly wrong. It\u2019s not going to end up being one of the worst movies of the year, but so far, it\u2019s the biggest letdown.\r\n\r\nRating: C-"
