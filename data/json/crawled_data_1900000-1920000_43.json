You would have thought that with such a budget they could have hired some guy to make a basic sanity check of the script but obviously that wasn\u2019t in the budget for this one. I do not know if a lot of Hollywood people are idiots or think the audience are idiots or both but for Christ sake, how difficult can it be to come up with a plot that holds together and are at least half believable?\r\n\r\nA trillion dollar expedition to discover the \u201cmakers of mankind\u201d and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from Earth.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone behaves in a completely unbelievable way. Yeah, it looks okay so let\u2019s remove the helmets for instance? Right, apart from the immediate danger to your own health, what about quarantine procedures\u2026idiots?\r\n\r\nWhy did the robot put the mutagen in the drink? It\u2019s just illogical and never really adequately explained. Speaking of robots, robots have a power source and it\u2019s not spread all over them. If you rip their head of they do not continue to talk like nothing had happened. In the original Alien they at least had to hook him up to something. It goes on. The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. \r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. What a joke. Apart from the fact that Elizabeth\u2019s actions are just ridiculous, how does she expect to live on a alien ship without food or any other supplies?\r\n\r\nThis film had good promise. The idea of getting to know the origin of the aliens intrigued me and the basic plot idea was cool. However, the film was really ruined by a script obviously written by total morons."

Music is by Lucas Vidal and cinematography by Uta Briesewitz.\r\n\r\nDetroit falls dark and silent and people are disappearing into thin air. A tiny group of survivors \"exist\"...\r\n\r\nWell it went down like a lead balloon! Critics and horror fans alike can't find much to like about it. It's certainly a tricky film to have confidence in recommending to anyone, for it's a bit short on answers and scares, sort of? However, considering the budget there's some technical guile here, and if giving the makers some credit, there's possibly intelligence of thought in the writing as well. Religio observations, a sly incorporation of the Roanoke colony disappearance and an existential undercurrent.\r\n\r\nYet it's such a frustrating picture, especially if you are a fan of Anderson's best works, or even if you rock up expecting the scarer that the adverts and plot synopsis' suggested. Cast are by the numbers wasted due to being hamstrung by the plot's attempt at blending chills with deeper thought, rendering the characterisations as unfleshed, while the ending feels like a cheat of unfinished business.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm glad I didn't pay at the cinema to see it, but with that comes the fact that in my darkened living room the other night I enjoyed it to a point. But here's a thing, it probably needs a second viewing for it to breathe better, but I'm not sure I could ever sit through it again... 6/10"

It\u2019s enjoyable, it\u2019s well casted and it\u2019s cute without being too cheesy. It\u2019s also the third miss in a row for Pixar.\r\n\r\nMU, just like Brave (and unlike Cars 2) is filled with merit, and well worth watching. But in 1995 when Pixar came out swinging with Toy Story, people expect that sort of a trend to continue. Which it did! Right up until 2006, when they released their seventh film (Cars); the first film they\u2019d gotten behind that didn\u2019t blow audiences world wide out of the Goddamn water. Pixar\u2019s limped up and down the approval ladder ever since, with MU sitting comfortably somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is a great film. Especially for a kids\u2019 film, especially for a prequel, all of that, but it is not the return to greatness audiences keep hoping for. It plays it safe, it lulls in the dreary, rarely well-pulled-off format of \u201cCollege Comedy\u201d (which is again, a safe area to sit in). It may not be as triumphant as the original, but it\u2019s not all together disappointing either.\r\nThe film does what virtually any film with large amount of money behind it does: It stands in front of you for an hour and a half, does its job in the entertainment industry of \u201centertaining\u201d you, then it sidles out, leaving you smiling, but not thoroughly satisfied. It takes as few risks as possible, and vehemently avoids anything new, just in case it pisses people off, and risks not making their money back.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s fine, people of the world are used to this, it\u2019s a fun ride, and then it\u2019s done. Worth your money, worth your time, but not what people have come to expect from the powerhouse of Pixar\u2019s heyday. \r\n\r\n74%\r\n\r\n-Gimly"

            "review": " It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about \"nothing new on the table\" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that \"haunt\" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\r\n\r\nForget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\r\n\r\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the clich\u00e9 conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls \u2013 breath holding games of hide and seek \u2013 to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\r\n\r\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10\r\n"

I mean, please, this film could be a lesson all on its own on how not to write a decent screenplay. Its all in here: one-dimensional characters, supremely poor pacing, multiple threads that go absolutely nowhere and completely implausible action sequences.\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, it's just a B-thriller. It's not like I haven't seen these mistakes time and time again. What really bothers me is just how highly it thinks of itself. It not only thinks it's interesting (which it isn't whatsoever), but it thinks it's smart, edgy, and it probably even thinks it's clever. I mean, there are so many characters who function for exactly one plot point and are then left behind in the dust. For example, this one chick who's name I forget (did they ever even say her name?) is introduced fairly early on in the film, and looks even like Russell Crowe's love interest. We see the very, very beginnings of a meaningful relationship forming and then it turns out that she was only a device to fill in a little potential plot hole (trying not to spoil the movie.) The same with Russell Crowe's parents, there are a handful of scattered scenes with them showing little glimpses of a meaningful relationship, and then the same exact friggin' thing is done, they're used as a simple (and illogical) plot mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt's almost like one of Paul Haggis's friends was reading the script and said \"hey, Paul, this is completely ridiculous, how could they possibly manage to _________\" and Haggis wrote in these characters as devices to satisfy the issue, realized they were one-dimensional, and wrote in a pseudo-intelligent relationship (which doesn't in reality make them any better.) And this is how the first 2/3 of the movie moves so dreadfully slowly. I mean, I'm absolutely confident that with a decent editor, the first hour and fifteen minutes could be whittled down to maybe half an hour.\r\n\r\nThey could have especially left out the symbols that don't actually symbolize anything. Which seems silly to say, but the jar of quarters that keeps recurring in the movie not only has no plot significance, but has zero metaphorical significance. They barely explained what they were doing in their house. They were quite literally only in the film to make it look a little deeper. Not to make it more meaningful, but to make it look more meaningful. To make it \"smart,\" and \"edgy,\" and \"clever.\" I don't usually have a problem with making it through a movie but I had to push to make it through this ludicrous, self-righteous mess."

However, it doesn't quite come together cohesively enough to be enjoyed on a major level.\r\n\r\nI didn't dislike <em>'Dream House'</em>, I found it alright to be honest. Craig (Will), as alluded to, is enjoyable in the main role, with Rachel Weisz (Libby) and Naomi Watts (Ann) being solid supports. The casting is probably the best thing about this film. It's the execution of the plot that holds it back.\r\n\r\nWhat's produced is watchable, but doesn't - at least for me - connect on any hearty level. The final act is a little clunky and messy, despite a nice reveal earlier on in the 84 minutes . It's definitely an interesting concept, but it's mostly a wasted one by the end. Reportedly, along with director John Sheridan, Craig and Weisz disagreed with the producer's final cut - no blame to them, if so.\r\n\r\nCraig, the idea and the run time stops this leaving a negative memory. I likely won't revisit it, but it's an OK - if underwhelming - production."

CJ Adams gives a respectable and sweet performance as Timothy, while Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton bring the heart in their roles as Cindy and James. The other characters are absolutely terrible, I will say that - especially Rosemarie DeWitt's Brenda.\r\n\r\nWhat it severely lacks in a supporting cast, it makes up for with its hearty narrative and nicely paced story. I don't think it's perfect or anything close, but it brings the feels that it intended to bring. Definitely worth a watch."

            "review": "> Half movie, half documentary, the story of most crucial scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe film was inspired by the real life stories of the two women from the same timeline who had no connections, except theirs involvement with something. That means there are two sets of stories that's told one after another in parts which covered the events from nearly the three decades. So it all begins in the 1960, where two little sisters promise to each other about something, but 10 years later one of their's life changed forever when another one dies of cancer. So this is the story where the other sister begins her fight against the disease that took her family away.\r\n\r\nThis is a small budget film that shot entirely within a month of time. There are lots of actresses in this, even for the small roles. I thought Helen Hunt would lead the narration, but then there were Maggie Grace, Alice Eve, Aaron Paul and others. Great dedications by all, but this was Samantha Morton's film.\r\n\r\nI did not know what this story is about when I decided to watch, but I'm pretty happy for the film. Except the material was more a documentary suitable kind, especially the story of Helen Hunt's character. Moreover feels like it is a short film with a decent story. I think it is worth a watch because of unfolding an important scientific discovery of our time. So a big yes on that perspective, but entertainment wise it is just an average. Now you can decide this on what you're seeking.\r\n\r\n7/10"

They start over in southwestern Ohio and John insists on going to high school where he meets a special girl (Dianna Agron). Callan McAuliffe is on hand as a notorious geek at school while Teresa Palmer plays a mystery woman whose identity is revealed in the last act.\r\n\r\n\u201cI Am Number Four\u201d (2011) was based on the book by Pittacus Lore (aka James Frey & Jobie Hughes). I never heard of the flick until stumbling upon it on streaming. It turns out that this was a fairly big production, costing $60 million and being produced by Michael Bay. \r\n\r\nDirected by D.J. Caruso, the film starts out too busy, like it\u2019s in a rush, not to mention there\u2019s zero subtlety about the nature of the protagonists and their extraterrestrial-oriented dilemma. But the flick soon finds its footing once the setting switches to Ohio and John goes to school. This, of course, brings to mind \u201cTwilight\u201d (2008), but \u201cI Am Number Four\u201d is way more ballsy. Yes, it\u2019s comic booky, but who cares? It delivers the goods as sci-fi drama/action.\r\n\r\nThe creativity turned my head on a few occasions and when Teresa Palmer shows up in the final act, it\u2019s all the better. Then there\u2019s the cute dog with a revelation. Unfortunately, there was never a sequel even though the ending lays the groundwork. While the movie made $55 million domestically and $150 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment. The fools.      \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in southwestern Pennsylvania as follows: Monaca (Sam\u2019s house), Murrysville (high school), Beaver & Beaver Falls (the falls, etc.), McKeesport (house party & police car scenes), Vandergrift (street light explodes), Harmony (cemetery scene) and Pittsburgh. The opening was shot in Islamorada, Florida, with a scene or two done in Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.\r\n\r\nDespite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).\r\n\r\nThe best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likeable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film!\r\n\r\nMost of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.\r\n\r\nIt's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status/settling in nicely behind Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.\r\n\r\nFor more reviews, visit www.ireviewfilms.com"

            "review": "Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years and\u0085little known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.\r\n\r\nAnd like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?\r\n\r\nBut all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.\r\n\r\nWhere the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nThere's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective.\r\n\r\nThe movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with \"There's Something About Mary\", just with not as good a payoff.\r\n\r\nHannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though.\r\n\r\nThe women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels.\r\n\r\nSo I go 6 out of 10 on this one.

There are loads of great sci-fi films were made recently and still coming out. So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.\r\n\r\nThe story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable. But I warn the grownups, stay away, or be like them while watching it, in order to get entertained.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"

Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.\r\n\r\nThe original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.\r\n\r\nRenee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.\r\n\r\nThis is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well. So choosing it to watch is not a bad idea.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"
