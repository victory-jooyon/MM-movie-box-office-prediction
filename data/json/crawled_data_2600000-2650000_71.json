            "review": "'The Martian\u2019 is definitely in the creative wheelhouse of filmmaker Ridley Scott whose Science Fiction sensibilities are grounded in colorful futuristic fantasies that tiptoe in grand whimsy.  The veteran auteur responsible for such pop cultural high-minded spectacles in \u2018Alien\u2019, \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 and even the mixed bag reception of \u2018Prometheus\u2019 certainly brings a sophisticated and thought-provoking vibe to the probing aura of \u2018The Martian\u2019. As with other Scott-helmed productions, \u2018The Martian\u2019 settles nicely in its majestic scope that taps into visual wonderment, humanistic curiosities, technical impishness and the surreal spryness of the SF experience.\r\n\r\nThe exploratory nature of \u2018The Martian\u2019 is its own noteworthy mission. Scott arms his frothy planetary odyssey with a sense of thematic inquisitiveness and intelligence while meshing human consciousness and scientific forethought. Clearly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is astutely meditative and one can thankfully block in their memory banks some of Scott\u2019s mediocre misses (anyone care to recall the monumental mishaps in the form of the flimsy \u2018The Counselor\u2019 or the unintentional laughfest that was \u2018Exodus: Gods And Kings\u2019?). Rightfully so, \u2018The Martian\u2019 shares its crafty crater of similarities with other space-place spectacles that resonated with the imagination and innovation such as the Academy Award-winning \u2018Gravity\u2019 and the under-rated \u2018Interstellar\u2019. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is elegantly arresting in its sheer skin for both the character studies and the major plight involved (particularly anchored on the shoulders of star Matt Damon as the contemplative lead) as well as the trademark Scott-induced flourishes that incorporate crisp and cunning visual special effects and a sweeping musical score that invites a transfixing hold on one\u2019s indelible spirit.\r\n\r\n\u2018The Martian\u2019 is the film adaptation of Andy Weir\u2019s best-selling tome. Scott\u2019s disciplined direction and screenwriter Drew Goddard\u2019s ambitious vision of Weir\u2019s compelling written material seemingly gels in convincing, cerebral fashion. The premise is not wildly original as it revisits the familiar foundation of a lost soul in survival mode trying to take on the treacherous surroundings with philosophical conviction. Nevertheless, this does not make \u2018The Martian\u2019 any less formidable in its soul-searching perspective. Scott\u2019s narrative on individualism and isolation with a tremendous technological tilt truly registers with boisterous bounce. Amazingly, Scott has assembled a capable and committed cast that are dedicated to making \u2018The Martian\u2019 look resourcefully skillful in its masterful mischievousness. Sure, The Martian\u2019s lengthy running time is staggering but it is compelling enough to invest in its meandering, adventurous narrative.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate nightmare (or perilous predicament\u2026take your choice) has been realised for one stranded space traveler in Mark Watney (Matt Damon). You see\u2026poor astronaut Watney had the misfortune of losing contact with his commander in Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of his crew when undergoing a scientific expedition to examine the terrain on Mars. Courtesy of an unexpected freakish storm Watney is separated from his comrades and believed to be dead as a result of the hazardous weather conditions on Mars. Lewis and her associates have no choice but to head back to Earth as searching for Watney may prove to be futile and endanger their lives as well.\r\n\r\nThus, Mark Watney is basically his own forced-upon version of \u2018Robinson Crusoe On Mars\u2019. There is no option for Watney but to allow his major survival instincts to kick in while striving for his jeopardised livelihood on the unpredictable and treacherous Red Planet\u2019s jagged landscape. Despite being stuck in hostile territory, Watney must use his background skills as a trained botanist to cultivate the scarce food he must rely on for his unconventional nutrition. The only \u2018companion\u2019 that Watney has to relate to rests in the recorded device that captures his harried thoughts through video diaries (at least this is more practical than what Tom Hanks\u2019s \u2018Castaway\u2019 character had in his possession with inanimate object best buddy, Wilson the volleyball).\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the devastating news about Mark Watney\u2019s possible death far beyond the reaches of home hits his colleagues understandably hard as tributes start to pour in remembrance of the seemingly dearly departed space pioneer. Soon, there is some measure of hope when NASA officials that include head honchos Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels from TV\u2019s \u2018The Newsroom\u2019), Vincent Kapoor (the Oscar-nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor from \u201912 Years A Slave\u2019) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) find evidence that Watney may be alive and ready to be rescued. Naturally, a sense of urgency is warranted to retrieve the weary astronaut without causing too many public relations waves. This puts press aide Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) into damage control mode in particular.\r\n\r\nOkay...so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nOkay\u2026so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nImportantly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is clever and carefully conceived because it does not have to rely on the excess baggage to convey its entertainment value in a series of hyperactive and hedonistic happenings. Ridley Scott is soundly methodical in presenting a low-key terrifying tale of loneliness and resiliency and what it takes to handle the pressure of adversity when there is no glimmer of humanity around to reinforce or remind one of such psychological obstacles. The intriguing factor here is the science-friendly serving of intelligence and insight that builds up the audience\u2019s appreciation for the underlying suspense. Interestingly, the conflict approached in \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not so much the back-and-forth high-scale struggles of man versus outlandish creature or an over-the-top diabolical deviant out to destroy the world in cartoonish fashion. No, the genuine combative and confrontational war of will is contained in one vulnerable man\u2019s ability to face the unknown grounded in both doubt and determination. Hence, Scott has made a palpable thinking man\u2019s Science Fiction exposition rooted in articulated forethought.\r\n\r\nDamon more than holds his own as the disillusioned botanist/astronaut out on an ominous limb as his doomed odyssey of uncertainty is something that the common viewer can embrace and relate to without question. The perceived opulence in \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not contained in the film\u2019s production values per se (Scott has made previous movies with more visual vitality and purpose) but subtly showcased in the concepts of  knowledgeable tidbits concerning food rations, mathematical equations, crucial time tables, planetary probes, NASA-themed procedural techniques and aerodynamics considerations.\r\n\r\nHopefully, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not dismissed as a foreign alien in the minds of ardent movie-going SF enthusiasts looking for a realistic and soulful space-age adventure with a refreshing backbone of scientific curiosity and candidness.\r\n\r\nThe Martian (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 35 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover and Benedict Wong\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ridley Scott\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Space Adventure/Science and Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)"

When shady Roman leader Tiberius (Adrien Brody) arrives with an army of 100,000, the other two groups team-up against them.\r\n\r\nSupposedly inspired by real-life events, \"Dragon Blade\" (2015) is a Chinese action/adventure that cost $65 million and looks it. The film is top-of-the-line as far as production quality goes (score, cast, costumes, sets, quick editing, locations, etc.). Chan is entertaining as usual while Cusack and Brody surprisingly tower in their roles (I say \u201csurprisingly\u201d because I wouldn\u2019t have imagined them cutting it as Roman commanders in the ancient past). The tone is serious with goofy quick-edited action and a modest amount of humor that\u2019s actually funny.\r\n\r\nIf you happened upon any 2-3 minutes of this film you\u2019d automatically think that it was a very worthy adventure flick. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too manic for its own good. I tried to adapt to its hyper tone and did so until just past the halfway mark when the overkill action style pretty much lost me. I endured to the end, but it was difficult. It seriously needed to slow down and cultivate depth (but at least it tries to at times). \r\n\r\n\u201cDragon Blade\u201d lacks the confident poise of the excellent \u201cMongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan\u201d (2007) and instead shoots for overKILL. Consider the frenzied pace of the 2011 version of \u201cConan the Barbarian,\u201d but up the ante a couple of notches. That\u2019s this movie.      \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Hengdian and Dunhuang, China, as well as the Gobi Desert.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

This is a tale of a struggling writer who goes to a French seaside resort for an inspiration to write a new material. He takes his wife along and in the peaceful environment, seems they're doing well, until a newly married couple arrive for their honeymoon in their next door. All the complication surface and the old secrets are revealed, so that's how the film sets up and ends.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's with Jolie lately, she's not doing many films as she was before. Maybe her parenting commitment took over her acting career. Good to see her back, but seeing this film and its story, I feel she's really suffering that I don't know what it is. Some day in the near future if someone makes a film about her, that will reveal this time of her life. Anyway, they both looked great on the screen, but very sad they are parting away.\r\n\r\nThis is not some awesome story with twist and turns, just a straightforward drama, mostly the midlife crises in a married life. So here the performances were top notch, other than that is the beautiful locations. It's a two hour long film, not everybody feel comfortable with that, because the pace was very slow and the story is not that interesting. Particularly this film is not for the youngsters, but that does not mean all the grown-up would enjoy it either. Only some people find it better and for me this is an okay film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

I don't know how it was put under 'found footage' subgenre film, since the webcams involved I think it is very much valid. There are lots of interesting stats for this like it is a $1m film, 80 minutes long, shot within the 16 days, but made to look like a single shot film in real time. This is a story of friends gang whose friend was recently committed suicide. Like usual one day, they are all hanging out on the Skype for a group chat, finds a stranger contact live among them who claims she's their dead friend. So the quest begins to find who really it is and what is the purpose behind such a pose.\r\n\r\nThis story is very familiar. Like a gang was put together in a room and revealing each others secret to bring total chaos. Take for example 'Cube'. What follows is we all know which is actually a famous clich\u00e9 in a thriller like this. So I thought similar way for this and it was, but only in a digital format where the current world trend stands. So this film can be enjoyed by youngsters and those who are familiar which internet forums like facebook, skype, google, email et cetera. In the entire film, all you would see is the computer screen. So you have to quick where mousing is moving and text was composed and concentrating the audio comments. Something like sitting next to a friend's computer and looking what he's doing.\r\n\r\nI think it was a good film, keeps us guessing till the final minute. I'm watching it a bit late, but very happy I did not miss it after all and there is already a second film getting ready which is due this year's end. But I doubt the film won't get anywhere near to this one. The franchise might end up like 'Paranormal Activity' if sequels keeping coming. The actors were good though. I thought one of them was Jennifer Carpenter where one of the film posters resembles 'Quarantine', but during the watch I realised it was a different actress.\r\n\r\nDespite the familiar theme, the setting makes all the difference and pretty entertaining. The end scene was a surprise, because until that point I was not aware of this film genre. Definitely worth a watch for modernising the old storyline with lots of suspense.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "**When the family needs you the most...**\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is the best film of the year, because there are plenty of better films than this, but in some way this film wins our heart. First of all I did not know John Krasinski directs films. In fact, this is his second feature film, the only one I have seen and I loved it. The main reason to I enjoy it was, it is sentimental. Not just some foolish melodrama, but an uplifting film filled with lots of fun.\r\n\r\nThe cast was at its best. I liked everyone and their unique display. At some point it feels like a realistic drama, but those comedies make us realise that it's only a film. Margo Martindale was really awesome. I have never seen her in such a wonderful role. Most importantly in an important role like this one. If I remember this film in the future, that's only for her. The only negative about the film was the twist. It was like they aimed for it to bring change in pace and atmosphere, when the situation in the story was not in its favour. Even though I did not care it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the Hollar family who reunite when they needed for each other. When John comes to know his mother got ill, he immediately flies back home. His brother is already there and the father is financially struggling. With many struggles, they all prepare for the medical procedure. In the meantime, there are some outside adventures. Like meeting their old friends, places, ex-wife et cetera. The remaining of the film is to reveal how it all goes and where they will stand.\r\n\r\nThe target audience is mainly the families. If you like a tearjerker, you would enjoy watching it as well. So in my opinion, this film is under-rated and under-noticed. Mainly because of the cast is not so popular and so the lack of promotion. Even the film poster is not that impressive. Kind of looks like a B movie and of course it is, but an awesome B movie. Worth a watch for many reasons and you will know it when you give it a try. So, recommended.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"

That's for a moment, once I finished watching it, realised it's a better film. I mean I changed my stance, after over and over thinking about the film. So its the patience you need, wait till the film to end to decide how much you liked it. It was too long, but every space was filled up with the best parts. It took time to understand the characters, and with multiple angle events in one woman's life. Isabelle Huppert was amazing. Despite so many characters in the film, she ruled it. One of her best films I have seen.\r\n\r\nThe film focused on the boss of a video game designing firm. It opens with as she's been sexually assaulted in her home by an intruder. Followed by one of her employees morphed her face to an animated character as a sexual explicit material for the game they are working in. So she begins her investigation to find both the culprit who might be the same person. This is where the suspense comes into play to develop interest in us. Besides, facing family troubles takes some extra development. Subsequently, all the mysteries will be solved and to know how it ends, you should watch it.\r\n\r\n> \"Michele to her cat: You did not have to claw his eyes out, but scratch him at least.\"\r\n\r\nIt is official French submission to the 89th American Academy Awards. But as per the latest news bulletin, this film is out of the Oscars race, despite made into the Golden Globes. From the director of the original 'Total Recall' and his first French film. Based on the book named 'Oh...'. But I felt it was developed from a small part of 'The Little Death'. Basically, there's an understanding being it is the story of the adults, despite the sexual violences and that's how this story was built. So you must compromise on a few things that is shown in it if you really want to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI did not like it all the sudden, though looking back all the film events and joining them together made me see the film was decent. Especially that final line said by a woman who was evacuating her house makes whole thing sense. Maybe that's the real twist in the tale. Initially I did not think to write a review, but surely it deserved one from me, so I wrote this short and quick. This is the film for the grown ups, but not for all the grown ups. So I hope it will meet your expectation if you decide to try, but according to me definitely it is worth.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

I was talking about Maggie Smith, she's 82 years old and still her performances can compete with younger generation actors. The story was narrated from someone's perspective about the role she played, that's why it's little weakened, otherwise if she was in solo, it would have been an Oscar worthy. Incidentally, that someone was an actual writer, so the film ended up portraying her very well, beside himself.\r\n\r\nInspired by the real story of an old lady who lived in a van for the 15 years during the 70s in the London's residential driveways. This film tells the mystery behind the state of her condition and actions. Actually, I expected it to be like 'Little Miss Sunshine', a road film, but after learning it was a biopic I am impressed with the overall movie.\r\n\r\nAn heartfully enjoyable comedy-drama with a small suspense in the plot. In fact, the whole film developed pretty well because of the opening event that hidden from us to reveal at the conclusion. It was a bit of fantasy as well, especially the end was too much of it.\r\n\r\nOn the Mary Shepard character, it reminded me Mrs. Julia Wicket from the Mr. Bean's animated series. Similar kind of attitude like don't care about others, especially when everyone around her showing some kind of respect and care, she was more a sceptical for us. The film was shot in the real locations. That was an advantage for filmmaking, and for us to witness from very close to the original.\r\n\r\n8/10"

            "review": "Don't let the title and promotional material fool you: Kong Skull Island is more military commentary and homage to Apocalypse Now than simply _another_ King Kong movie. In that sense it brings something new and fresh to the series, and is also very much a period piece--a period that all too recently seemed to be contemporary history, not the distant and unfamiliar past in which the film takes place.\r\n\r\nAfter a prologue set during WWII, the current setting of the film opens in the waning days of the Vietnam War. While plenty of films have explored the war in Vietnam, Kong eschewed using combat or anti-war demonstrations on the homefront as the focal point. The Draft, flag burnings, use of the term \"Charlie,\" etc are all absent from the film. Instead, it takes the unique perspective of war from an elite group of soldiers contemplating going home--back to \"The World.\" While some characters look forward to reuniting with friends and family, the contempt for the army and the war that is seen in other Vietnam movies is also absent. These guys are soldiers and they are proud of that; it means something. Their commander is portrayed as an old war horse who is contemplating a future with no war to fight. \r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, two scientists named Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), lobby to have a military escort assist them in exploring an uncharted island. Randa and Brooks assemble their team which consists of tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddelston) photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) a geologist San (Jin Tian) and a few other scientists not fleshed out enough to even remember. \r\n\r\nThey meet up with Lt. Col. Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and the the soldiers we met earlier in the film. With all these convenient characters in place, the movie really begins.\r\n\r\nThe film shifts gears from being a period piece that goes out of its way--sometimes with distracting effect--to showcase outdated technology (a scene in which the camera pans to a table of rotary phones and then lingers for a few seconds comes to mind), to a Tarantino-esque homage to Vietnam War movies. The cinematography is excellent. Jordan Vogt-Roberts makes good use of the physical environment (coincidentally, Vietnam) and made me realize just how in need we were of a beautiful Vietnam War movie in the age of 4K and Real 3D. \r\n\r\nComplete with Credence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane songs, equipment-laden soldiers marching through swamps, dogtags clinking together, their helmets advertising what they decided to scribble on them, the jolly Green Giant presses on through the jungle--the director's love of Vietnam War movie visuals on full display, the movie moves along with great fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the titular character first shows up, the action-packed visuals begin to detract very quickly from the mood Jordan Vogt-Roberts established in the first third of the movie. In the excessive age of more is better, the movie stumbles a bit, threatening to collapse under the weight of its title monster. \r\n\r\nThankfully Kong is reigned in and the human characters are able to command some attention. At this point, the camp is divided in two: Military vs. Civilian. While the Army soldiers are on a rescue mission to bring back one of their own, the civilian folks meet up with the island's native population--including a downed WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) who's been on the island for 30 years. Through him we learn that Kong is a protector of the island. That he is, in fact, not the monster at all. \r\n\r\nPackard is not having any of this, of course, because Kong killed some of his men. This is where the movie makes its statement. Kong is the combatant that fights to protect the natives--much the way Packard and his men are portrayed. Packard mentions that soldiers do the dirty work so our friends and family back home don't have to be afraid. In this, Kong and Packard have a kinship--common ground shared by all soldiers: They do the dirty work so you don't have to. Unable or unwilling to see this, Packard decides to wage a personal war against Kong.\r\n\r\nThis is unwise as Kong protects the island from \"Skullcrawlers\"--massive lizard-like creatures who would eat any living thing on the island if not for Kong's presence. \r\n\r\nThe civilians begin to see Kong as not only necessary, but as compassionate and humane. He saves a trapped water buffalo, marvels at the sight of the aurora borealis, and has a brief but tender moment with Conrad and Weaver. He is the soldier whom, during a lull in the battle, is shown as a well-rounded individual, a reminder that being a soldier is something one does; not something one is. This is also true of other soldiers in the film, such as Cole and Mills. Packard, however, has gone off the deep end. A showdown between he and Kong is inevitable, and with Kong out of commission, the Skullcrawlers are able to run amok and create problems for our heroes.\r\n\r\nAt this point Kong is miraculously resurrected to save the day because the scrip said so. And he does. And the film ends on the sappiest, corniest, and most contrived of happy Hollywood endings.\r\n\r\nWhere the film works, it works well. Its commentaries on soldiers and soldiering are interesting without being heavy handed. Despite the Vietnam backdrop, Jordan Vogt-Roberts avoids making a commentary about the Vietnam War specifically, avoiding political controversy in the process. The actors make good use of what material they have to turn in decent performances. In a movie with Brie Larson, Tom Hiddelston and Samuel L. Jackson, it's John C. Reilly, Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham who steal the show. Also, Kong looked terrific. The CGI work is better than what the Peter Jackson remake gave us--though the Skullcrawlers looked laughably cartoonish.\r\n\r\nBut, the movie has its faults as well. Its parallels to Apocalypse Now can be distracting at times. As is common with ensemble pieces, there are too many characters on the screen for any one of them to get enough screen time to become memorable. Hiddleston in particular had the least material to work with. His character--such as it was--had no depth or personality. He was simply action movie trope. The interactions between Larson and Kong only work because we know that King Kong has always been a Beauty and the Beast tale. It's forced. Giant ape and pretty blonde get along, because it's a Kong movie. For the uninitiated, it could just feel jarring and uneven.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, the film succeeds as a blockbuster to eat popcorn to. Yet it tries, with varying degrees of success, to reach beyond that. While Kong deserves an A for effort, a B- is all it achieves in its execution. Also, the interesting and unique aspect of combining Vietnam War movies with the Kong mythos is highly rewarding for the audience.\r\n\r\nBetter than average, but still far from perfect."

It doesn\u2019t even manage to be a fun, brainless monster movie, assuming that a satisfying monster battle is all about being big and loud and doing nothing else. We waited five years for the follow-up to \u2018Godzilla\u2019, which only makes this new film even more of a disappointment, and doesn't excuse the badly-written screenplay or the poorly-executed visual effects.

            "review": "Like I said in 'Song of the Sea' review, its a 3D animation dominated world. That's mainly in Hollywood, but trend spreading so fast everywhere. Even the Japan shifting gear from anime to 3D anime, I saw it in 'Space Pirate: Captain Harlock'. From a comic book to 2D animation is easy because they are much alike, but it's different when it comes to the 3D. I have seen Micky Mouse and Co transformed into 3D characters that I did not like, because some characters do not suit for that kind of leap. In Micky Mouse, the ears were the biggest drawback. But 'Tintin' was a success and so expecting 'Popeye' would do the same magic which is due next year (2016).\r\n\r\nI have seen all the 'Asterix & Obelix' movies so far from both the format, live-shot and animation, but this is the first 3D animation. I'm so happy that it came overall very well, every detail was retained. Even those mud-smoke/dirt-smoke (whatever it's called) shown exactly as it to be which forms during their fight after the consumption of magic potion. That concept is for comic book, to make understand the readers the situation because the picture is still. But in a motion picture you can show the whole action, if they make that change the trademark will lose. So I must praise the technical side of the movie for the lossless transformation.\r\n\r\nIt's like a new beginning in the series in the 'Asterix & Obelix' franchise. Especially this story was not freshly written for the screen, but taken straight from one of the comic books in the series called 'The Mansions of the Gods'. In 3D animation, emotions, violence, comedies would be a little realistic. That's why the movie like 'Brave', 'Frozen', 'Up' appealed strongly on the sentimental side. Gaul's favourite food, the wild boar hunting was compromised, because children would be watching the movie and it might disturb on the softer side of them. Just like the filmmakers avoided the Giant's children and women in 'Jack the Giant Slayer'.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things in 'Asterix & Obelix' movies is that the movie might not be awesome, but still it entertains and keeps you engaged. You can't spot the flaws, in animation all are relevant. A man can jump 1000 feet high and leap a mile away. So if there should be something, that must come from the technical side. Since it (Gauls in 3D) is new and so much fun, you can't concentrate finding those faults or you will miss the actual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n> \u2018\u2018It's weird that the house looks like a box.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nAs usual the story set in the first BC. The Gaul's enemy the Romans comes with a new strategy to defeat them. They begin to build the large mansions near to their village and later to invade by seducing the community by the Roman culture. So the fight begins between them where the innocent civilians and black slaves get affect more. But Gaul's main intention is to keep the ecosystem unaffected, especially they're against the Romans modern fancy civilization. What happens to the Julius Caeser's 'Veni, Vidi, Vici' is the movie's final battle to disclose.\r\n\r\nProbably a best 'Asterix & Obelix' movie compared to the previous couple of movies. Good to see a non-Hollywood 3D animated movie with a great quality and doing well commercially as well. A whole family together watchable movie, not only for the children. Hoping for the a sequel, I mean very soon. All the above it was short and sweet which runs about 80 minutes. If you are a fan of this comic, you will love it, because lots of the frames look alike. Must be dedicated  to the fans.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "> Another fat wedding in one big Greek family.\r\n\r\nA sequel after the 14 years, actually it was not bad. It followed a simple story of another fat wedding in the Toula's big family. Great to see them all once again, and I hope the third film as well will be made very sooner than another 14 years. This franchise has a wonderful set of the characters and each one was in a very unique that imprinted its trademark and so the film gave them all equal parts to explore the opportunity.\r\n\r\nYep, it's not anymore about Toula, particularly not in this part or if you're expecting it to be about her daughter, you will be disappointed, but it was a well distributed contents to all the characters and extracted as much as possible good comedies. Beside it was written by Toula (Nia Vardalos) like the previous film.\r\n\r\nMost of the stuff was as expected, like the slapstick humours. Not everybody would going love it, but if you had liked the first then definitely you would enjoy it as well. Even the first film was not a masterpiece and so this one yet undeniably a good entertainer. Nowadays, in this kind of theme you won't get a fresh storyline, but this one was very original. From the director by 'Everybody's Fine' fame, who really did a good job. A decent summer film, but a very enjoyable film with the family.\r\n\r\n6/10"

            "review": "> Never too late to fall in love!\r\n\r\nOn the budget of one million and the entire film was shot in less than a month, with not so marketable cast, I would say this film really did great. Critically acclaimed, film fanatics and people enjoyed it, as well as a wonderful box office against its spending. I loved the story which was obviously very simple in the line of 'Harold and Maude', but matured characters and well explored theme.\r\n\r\nSurely the character Doris was specially created Sally Field. She was amazing with other supporting cast. She as a 60 year old falling in love with a younger man who recently joined her office. And so the remaining film reveals how the story evolves with lots of enjoyable comedy sequences.\r\n\r\nThe music was good, especially the costumes of Doris, very colourful. How long we're going to watch the same old, old man romancing a young woman. This reverse was actually a less explore compared to that and this one is very pleasing in all the departments. One of the cute little romance-drama from the 2015 and you should try it if you're looking for a refresher.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "**He who became a people's hero by betraying his own nation!**\r\n\r\nI had like to begin by saying I'm not an American and I haven't seen the Oscar winning documentary 'Citizenfour'. But I'm very much aware of everything about it through the all kinds of coverages. So my perspective about the film will be true and about the content will be neutral. I have known about what this film dealt since the day it all began. I did not care much, but there are things to concern about it. Like if it is necessary to tap to prevent the serious threats, there's nothing wrong it that. Because, even if they have our private contents, they are not going to publish it or make money out of it. So that makes what Ed did was unethical and betrayal for his own country.\r\n\r\nIn another angle, NSA's illegal surveillance questionable in many ways, but wrong is only a tiny thing. Because eyeing every single one of us seems wrong, though without examining all, nothing confirms, differentiate between right and wrong. So coming to the film, it was decently made one. The main reason is it was too long and many parts were boring. The theme was powerful like it was a one liner, but the film contents were very weak. Except Snowden passing the security, the rest of the story like why he did, including his personal life, particularly his romance was not good enough to make a film. This is very much suitable for a documentary than a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut I liked the actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, but not great. If he gets the Oscars nod, that's only because of the issue which the film inspired by, not because his phenomenal character display. The direction was decent, but not the screenplay. The film is not for everyone, but I recommend it to all as a must see. The main reason why you should watch it is to educate yourself. To learn what they are doing and how. Particularly, you will definitely come to know how to avoid being eyed by the government in a simple way. So that's a good thing than whining over what homeland security does to protect the nation. It is not an inspiring biopic, or a masterpiece, but don't miss it for any cost.\r\n\r\nP.S. Whatever the form of the governments, the nations won't stop doing what in this film they said was wrong. Because there's no Edward Snowden in every nation to expose it. In that perspective, the US was really embarrassed for their own man letting them down. The China is the number one in this kind of activity. The point is, these things happening right now or not, but should never come to public notice like that happened in here, never should leave the compound. Suppose if we come to know, we will protect, at least in the democratic countries that's what we do. But not to forget it also safeguards us. That means it is like the stars and planets on the sky that we watch and take notes, but they are untouchable. We only monitor them for threats like asteroids and fractionally thinking about the alien invasion.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourse and after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from that point of the story where it stands to where it all began as per the film character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressive idea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters were drawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9\u00bd Weeks', the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narration alternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.\r\n\r\nI wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both the drama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended them together better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, one of the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could have happened to that particular character on which this plot was developed. If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adult contents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult film means teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90 minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent. The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But I would say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramatic segments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an average and a little below.\r\n\r\n_4.5/10_"

            "review": "Back in 1977 I remember going into the original Cine Capri to see \u201cStar Wars\u201d with some friends. I was very young but little did I know that movie would change my life and put me on the path that I am now. Over the decades that have followed I have read the books and comics, played with the toys, played the video games, and eagerly watched any new film or television show related to the franchise.\n\nThe fact that Disney has put out a new film every years since \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is great for fans like me as those three year waits; to say nothing of the 17+ years between the Original and Prequel Trilogies were tough.\n\nThrough it all my favorite character has always been Han Solo. I do not know what it is but the brash, cocky, money loving; scoundrel who gets in and out of trouble yet does the right thing in the end has always connected with me.\nSo when news came that there would be a new movie based on the early years of the title characters I was excited but concerned as Harrison Ford is so iconic in that role I could not see how anyone could measure up.\n\nCombine that with original Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being removed from the film after shooting a significant number of weeks, there was ample concern to go around.\n\nFortunately for fans, Director Ron Howard has crafted a very enjoyable film as \u201cHan Solo: A Star Wars Story\u201d deftly combines the action, visuals, and humor that made the films cinematic legends and in doing so introduces new characters and expands the lore of the Star Wars Universe.\n\nThe film follows a young Han (Alden Ehrenreich), who hustles to survive and get off the world of Corrilia.\n\nHan like many kids on the street pull all sorts of scams under the control of various criminals and he plots to escape with his friend Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke).\nWhen an opportunity arises, Han takes it, but finds himself in the Imperial Navy which does not bode well for a person with strong opinions and a mind of his own. \nFate steps in once again and introduces Han to Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and a mentor figure in the form of a man named Beckett (Woody Harrelson).   Han attempts to prove himself to his new crew as he sees this as his way out to a better life. However with things take a turn for the worse, he must work with his new associates to clear the slate with a deadly crime boss named Dry\u2019den Vos (Paul Bettany).  \nAs anyone who follows the series knows Han has a way of escalating a situation and this leads the crew to recruiting Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), into the crew as they set off to pull off a risky and dangerous mission to get the much needed resources to save their lives.\n\nWhat follows is a very enjoyable film that has an appropriate amount of humor and character building as well as plenty of good action and effects which should keep fans of the series happy. The new characters were very enjoyable and added a new depth to Han as well as the Star Wars mythos but what really impressed me was that at no time did I find myself comparing Ehrenreich to Harrison Ford. He was charismatic and enjoyable in the role and I easily believed that this was Han before life, the universe, and circumstances turned him into the man we would know years later.\nGlover is uncanny with his version of Lando and he at times almost sounded like Billy Dee Williams and had many of the mannerisms of the character down His back and forth with Han was great to see and we got a much deeper understand of both the characters and their complicated history with one another.\n\nClark and Harrelson round things out well as they provide a great balance to Han. One is a mentor and one is the link to the life he had and the dreams he wants to achieve.   Ron Howard moves things along well without rushing things as while it does take a bit of time getting up to speed, it happens at a natural pace without seeming rushed. Howard also does not rely on an abundance of effects to carry the film. There are plenty of practical FX and makeup creations to make you well aware that this is a vast and diverse galaxy but he uses them and the CGI to enhance the story rather than carry it.\n\nThere are numerous nods throughout to past films as well both visual and verbal and a few great surprises along the way. It is believed that more adventures of the younger Han will be coming in the future and I cannot wait for them to arrive as this was a very fun film. Now the only hard part will be the 19 month wait for Episode IX as the five month wait from the last film already seems like ages ago and I cannot wait for more.\n\n4.5 stars out of 5"

That's not it, so far he had failed to take the right project to work with. His films are either having no story or a silly concept and his roles among the worst. I could have liked this film if it was done by some other young actor. It looked a decent storyline on how an aspiring DJ is fighting to make progress. Living with his friends, then suddenly an opportunity knocks and followed by some issues surround it that should be solved to see the success in his passion in the music. So the remaining is to reveal how the things go on for him.\r\n\r\nToo slow narration, and it is being a music genre, a little soulless. Yeah, there's no rhythm. All we have seen a DJ while performing, but what his life would be like is what this film was focused on. Directional debute for a documentary filmmaker and he should make a couple of things right for his next film, including casting right actors and preparing an engaging screenplay. Some people might like the film, but not for me. This is completely an ignorable film.\r\n\r\n_4/10_"

Even the casting looks so bad. There are lots of big names for the women characters. Even for the tiny roles, Maggie Grace and Alexandra Daddario appeared. And I could not find one good male actor, apart from Tom Wilkinson. Sorry to say, but the lead actor was not the perfect choice. Besides, I find Teresa Palmer was over-performed her parts. If you have seen many romance flicks, you will find it clich\u00e9 in the many segments.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the book of the same name written by the 'The Notbeook' author. It is his another signature romance tale, but somewhat different from all his books those made into the films. I did not come here to write bad about it, but I could not find any good stuffs about it to give some credits. Maybe the location was great and music. The fun part is, I did not know anything about it, so when I decided to watch, I saw the poster and assumed it was a lesbian theme. Funny, but disappointed after realising the mistake.\r\n\r\nStill, some of the dialogues were below par, not romantic when those were delivered and then there're some silly scenes like the dog finding the lost object, including its following event. Those things make it more a supernatural film than actual world romance. The film is for a selected audience, I'm sure the film will find its audience today, tomorrow or even decades to come. But there will be people like me on the corner who say the film is not good, so ignore them if you really want to try it and decide yourself.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

            "review": "> An unexpected and thoroughly entertained retro comedy!\r\n\r\nIt all began from this year's Oscars, I saw this pair for the first time and I knew its their film promotion strategy. So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.\r\n\r\nIt is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.\r\n\r\nIt was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.\r\n\r\nIt's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.\r\n\r\n8/10"

            "review": "> Experiencing what Saul's seeing, hearing and undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe World War II is the largest source supplier for the war movies. I have seen numerous breathtaking braverism, as well as heartbreakingly suffering film characters which are based on the real and sometimes fiction. The genre too differs, from action, adventure, war to the comedy, romance, drama et cetera. Since the Academy Awards nominee announcement in the January I had an eye on this, but now it had won the Oscars that draw my interest even more on this. Anyway, finally saw this, so let me tell you what I feel about it.\r\n\r\nIt is no ones biopic, but inspired by a collection of testimonies of those who had made out alive from the Auschwitz. Like some of the WWII films, it is very unique, that focused on a particular event and a person. Saul is one of the prisoners in the Nazi held concentration camp who is a slave-labour. His job is to clean the place after prisoners were executed. One day he finds a young boy who was executed and soon he takes the responsibility to give him a proper burial. Risking his own life and others, he begins to find a rabbi to perform the last rites. So what happens later and how it ends is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nIt is not only enthralling story, but was very clever and unique filmmaking. In this whole film you will see one face at all the time in different angles and mostly they're close shots. Yes, Saul is everywhere, the camera never takes off its lens out of him. We would experience what he sees, listening and undertaking, more like in the real time. Just like a computer game where everything is from our (player's) angle, but here it is us again barely through the Saul's perspective. (Something like the upcoming Hollywood film 'Hardcore Henry' trailer I saw.)\r\n\r\nAlthough, the movies are not the games, like I felt weird during watching 'Need for Speed', when Aaron Paul was at my place. And a movie always needs a character that can take us to the journey through the time and space where it sets, otherwise it will be called a documentary film. The aspect ratio was like the older day films which is narrow that takes time for us to get used to it, yet it is a colour film. More like the entire story is taking place within the 48 hours. Interesting pace and developments, and a decent conclusion. I think it deserved all the praise and prizes given to it.\r\n\r\n> \"You have forsaken the living for the dead.\"\r\n\r\nI know the seriousness of the film and its contents, but I could not avoid the laugh at the end scene. I did not want to, but I did it without my self-awareness after seeing the Saul's face. I hope, there are others too, like me in that situation. Yet the storyline was very strong, like how far would a man can go knowing the life is meaningless after what he's going through. That makes him to take a solo mission when others are struggling and working together for their freedom.\r\n\r\nSince I don't know any language that spoken in the movie, I had no problem too to follow the movie. The 1944 settings were so realistic, I think everyone's hard-work was this film's result. All the performances were excellent, especially who played the Saul's role. That is the face no one is going to forget who had watched this film. However the real hero of the film was not the actors or the writers and the director, but the cameraman. Like I said earlier, he had done a brilliant job. If anyone wants to praise this film, he/she must begin with him. The cinematography award at the Oscars might have went to 'The Revenant', but the cameraman award is none other than this guy who shot this film.\r\n\r\nI really liked this film, but not overly sympathised or enjoyed. Usually if any movie that's based on the real gets my favour, even the movie has been low quality with more than ignorable flaws. Because telling the truth to the world is what I consider is foremost important than trying to get benefit out of it. But when it's not factual, I expect whatever the cinematical options can make it a better product.\r\n\r\nThis film comes between them both, but leans mostly on the truth about the World War II prison camp. An insight of what the prisoners have went through. Painful to watch a movie like this, at a time I appreciate the filmmakers for giving this film and let the younger generation know a tiny dot of the incident of the WWII. To watch this film, no one needs a reason. It is automatically a must see, but after watching it, whether you liked it or not is an individual opinion.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "In Velaiilla Pattadhari, we see Dhanush being criticized by his father for being jobless, doted on by his mother, pitied by the heroine and underrated by the villain. In essence, he is playing a role that he has played many times in his 25-films-old career. The plot, too, is a mixture of the relationship drama in his brother Selvaraghavan's films and our regular masala films, in which the David-like hero takes on the Goliath-like villain and brings him down to his knees. And, yet, the film feels fresh and Velraj (the cinematographer making his directorial debut) superbly manages to strike a balance between the emotional and mass hero moments. \r\n\r\nRaghuvaran (Dhanush) is a jobless youngster, who wants to take up only the job of a civil engineer, as that is what he has studied for. His unemployment is a reason for his father ( Samuthirakani) to berate him, more so because his brother, Karthik ( Hrishikesh), who is three years younger, is comfortably employed. The only support for him comes from his mother Bhuvana (Saranya) and Shalini ( Amala Paul), the girl next door, who gets why he wants only his dream job. A tragedy leads to Raghu finally catching a break and he is entrusted with a major project. However, the envious and arrogant scion of a rival developer ( Amitesh) is plotting to scuttle his plans and take over the project himself. \r\n\r\nThe first half of the film is its beating heart and Velraj nicely sets up the relationships between the characters. Raghuvaran's household is quite realistic and the interactions between the flesh-and-blood characters natural. When Raghu's mother comforts him in an earlier scene, she does so with a mixture of pride (he has designed a telescope-like object all by himself to ogle at the heroine) and hope that mothers usually have for their children. When he has a showdown with his father, we see how a normal argument can spill over into something bigger (Resenting the constant comparisons with his brother, he retorts that his parents named him after a villain while his brother has a hero's name). When his parents talk to each other, they speak in a manner in which people who have been married for years and understand each other talk. We are provided with little, little details about these people that we start believing them. For example, Raghu's father is younger than his mother and they married after falling in love and was a firebrand in his college days. his sophisticated brother went to an English medium school while the crude-on-the-outside Raghu did not. \r\n\r\nAnd despite being jobless, Raghu is not a wastrel. He drinks, smokes and seems crude on the outside compared to Karthik, but we are told the latter was sent to an English medium school while he wasn't. He is also frank enough to admit to Shalini that he is a little jealous of his brother but will not reveal to his father that it was he who helped the goody two shoes Karthik at a crucial stage. \r\n\r\nThe film changes colour in its second half and from a family drama, it becomes a commercial film. It is fantastic to see Dhanush take this boy-next-door to mass hero mode and he has quite a few punchy lines (he has a memorable breathless dialogue that is sure to be talked about). The actor seems to know that this is his show and puts quite an effort into the role, even though he has played such roles frequently. However, the problem is that the film pits him against an antagonist who is more of a wuss than a serious threat. \r\n\r\nThese portions also feel less organic compared to the ones in the first half. But the real trouble is that they also seem needlessly stretched. We get a comedy track of sorts (which while brining a smile also brings down the momentum) and a needless climatic fight (even after the villain has been vanquished) that is solely intended to showcase Dhanush's six-pack. This could still have been a rousing finish but the stunt choreography is quite dull that it fails to pack a punch."

This film was made using iPhone 5s and this is not some film school project. The quality was really top notch, with great performances by all who involved in. I have never seen such perfectly rendered transgender story. I mean no offense, but it looked so real. Hats off to the director, writer and the actors.\r\n\r\nLast year, there were some talks about this film's chances at the Oscars, but in the end it did not make. So after that I kind of lost interest in it, but now I had an opportunity to watch and I liked it very much. How a simple story and its simple characters developed were the highlights. You can't predict this stuff, because you won't know what comes after the each twist.\r\n\r\nMost of the film takes place on the evening time, so that colour of the sky is what the title represents. I don't think anybody would dislike this film. It was slow, but short and sweet. One of the best films from the 2015. You much choose this to watch for its uniqueness in the filmmaking and the storytelling. In addition to that, it also entertains, so there's your reason to go for it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

Stick to Predator and Predators."

            "review": "> A creepy Christmas tale of a family.\r\n\r\nProbably no one would have anticipated it, this is a surprise movie, especially being an anti-Christmas theme. Possibly the one last time I enjoyed was a Finnish film called 'Rare Export', that's the name came in my mind after watching this. I also could not believe this rated PG13, well it differs in other countries. Of course, there are plenty of intensified frightening scenes, even for the adults, but no gores. The violence parts were well edited/shot, yet it makes sure they're still part of the story without showing them. I think it was a smart filmmaking keeping in mind the family audience. So in the end, I guess it paid off well.\r\n\r\nI did not know the plot, as well as a few words that referred in the movie. But while watching it, I was worried about the graphics, because this is not a big budget film. Even the cast was not from the top league. Overall, it achieved a good result, that's the point. There are no major flaws as well, and the small ones can be easily ignorable. Because on the other side the movie provides a good suspenseful entertainment that makes you not to move the body or the eyeballs. After I'm saying all these, you should at least consider giving it a shot. But remember there's no story in it, it was constructed on a panic situation during the heavy blizzard when one after another begin to disappear.\r\n\r\n7/10"

But it was not popular as that one, because it was about the American politics, so seems the world did not care much. However, going down in the domestic market was a very sad. It was directed by the newcomer and he did a wonderful job, even for penning a good screenplay. But it was based on the memoir by Mary Mapes called 'Truth and Duty'.\r\n\r\nIt's a journalism theme, sets in during the months before the 2004 presidential election. It was focused on the CBS's famous news series '60 Minutes Wednesday' where its episodes reveals some of the copy documents how George W. Bush altered them get into the military in the 80s. Soon the producer to the host, everyone who involved in that show receive a backlash. In the remaining parts, it aims to disclose how the claimer decides to fight the issue and would they succeed?\r\n\r\nCate Blanchett was never attracted to me, but I never doubted her performances. So in this, she was amazing and quite physically looked beautiful. One of her great character display, and it should have nominated for the various awards, but I don't understand why it was discarded totally. The other actors too were awesome, Especially Robert Redford was superb as a news anchor. He's a bit old, otherwise I would have expected him to play Don Trump in a movie, maybe a biopic or comedy.\r\n\r\nLike the film revealed what happened to Mapes, I think those invisible and powerful men made this film does not get into the spotlight. But as I've seen, I say it's a must see film of the year, if you're interested in the US and its politics. How the story ends is sad, but I've seen other journalism films that highlights their strength, whereas this one was opposite. I loved the lines Cate delivered at one of the final scenes. I hope you watch it at least after reading my review.\r\n\r\n8/10"

I mean it was not based on the real or something, the film was not bad either. A decent story and performances, but partially an inspiring theme. You know, of course, in the sports its about winning the medals, only till certain stage, then the time comes to end our journey for various reasons. But still there are other ways to use our gifts like on coaching and encouraging the young talents. That's what this film is about, and I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nThe highlight was it looks some kind of a biographical film, but as I said it's not. I think the screenplay was well written, but pretty predictable story, especially the romance parts were outdated. The sport section was quite refreshing. The jokes were the okay type. The sex scene was awesome. It might be a little overdone, but well composed gymnastic poses. I liked the father-daughter sentiment. It was not emotional with great dialogues, but still a father fighting for his daughter to stand on her own feet was really good to see.\r\n\r\nIt is a chick flick, so both the lead girls were excellent. Pretty much impressive gymnastic stunts. Obviously the stunt double used for some of those parts. Had a good runtime and shot in wonderful places. A small budget film that shot within a month of time, but a great production quality. Entertaining film, but disappointment is it did not do well as expected at the box office. It is not a greatest sports film of all time, but I think there's no harm watching it once, you will realise that after giving it a try.\r\n\r\n7/10"

Like in the animated film he is separated from his mother and soon becomes an unlikely circus act when it is discovered that his giant ears give him the power of flight. \r\nIn the new version we are introduced to Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell); who returns from WWI injured and dealing with the fact that his wife has died  and he must raise their two children alone. Further complicating matters is the fact that Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito), has sold the prized horses Holt used in his act in an effort to keep his struggling circus alive. \r\nWhat has become a tragedy soon becomes a boon when wealthy industrialist V.A. Vandevere (<ichael Keaton) offers to make Max a partner and take him and his troup on at his fabled entertainment park with Dumbo as his featured star. \r\nIt is at this point where the film takes some wild deviations and becomes very linear with paper thin characters and an emphasis on effects over story. \r\nDirector Tim Burton has once again crafted a film filled with lavish visuals as his take on the entertainment park and circus is amazing; but it as usual comes at a cost. Like most of Burton\u2019s works, the visuals are the star and key element and the development of characters and story are often given little more than lip service. \r\nThe same is true fro this film as we learn noting about the motivation of the characters and the villains play out as stock baddies without even a nod as to why they are so inclined to tehir action.s They are being evil just for the sake of being evil. The same can be said for the other characters as we are given very little reasons to care for them. There is a nice subplot with Eva Green but it is never fully developed and the worst part is that the title star almost becomes an afterthought in the final acts so we can be given scene after scene of lavinsh park visuals. \r\nThe film may be a bit to dark and intense at times for younger viewers and those who remember the original may have a hard time with this take of the film. It entertains at times but could have been so much better. \r\n3 stars out of 5 \r\n \r\nSecond review by Tracey Barrientos\r\nIn 1941 Walt Disney Pictures brought audiences around the world the fourth animated Disney feature film Dumbo. 78 years later Disney has partnered with Tim Burton to bring audiences of new generations a fresh and live action take on the classic tale.\r\nAfter returning home and left injured from the war, Holt Farrier (Collin Farrell) unites with his kids and his beloved job and home. His home is a traveling circus and his act has been cut due to his injury. Max Medici (Danny DeVito) the owner of the circus asks him to forget about the act and instead take care of a newborn elephant with hopes that the young elephant would help the once booming but now looming circus. The peculiar pachyderm nicknamed Dumbo with extremely oversized ears is the new laughingstock of the circus until Holt\u2019s children discover the magic within Dumbo. He can fly and is attracting attention from all around.\r\nAs a huge Tim Burton fan I was ecstatic to hear that he was set to direct the live action version of the beloved film. A fantastic cast was put together and to be honest I don\u2019t know that anybody else could\u2019ve played those roles as well as Collin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin just to name a few. They brought a sense of magic and true emotion to each character which added depth and soul to the film. Every time the first note from Danny Elfman\u2019s music reaches my ear I instantly get goosebumps. I was extremely happy to here that familiar music in this film. As with all of Tim Burton\u2019s films, it gave a touch of magic and intrigue that Dumbo deserved. The colors were beautiful and vibrant but still held drab contrast to what we are normally used to.\r\nI was asked a little bit ago if the film made me cry. The answer is I did. Both with sad and happy tears. A film that encapsulates so many emotions in only two hours and leaves you with a happy heart, THAT is what I look for in a film. That is what a film should make an audience feel. A good tug at those heart strings along with happiness and laughter is the perfect formula. Well done Mr. Burton! I recommend this film to be seen by fans old and new because you won\u2019t be disappointed.\r\n5 out of 5!"
