You would have thought that with such a budget they could have hired some guy to make a basic sanity check of the script but obviously that wasn\u2019t in the budget for this one. I do not know if a lot of Hollywood people are idiots or think the audience are idiots or both but for Christ sake, how difficult can it be to come up with a plot that holds together and are at least half believable?\r\n\r\nA trillion dollar expedition to discover the \u201cmakers of mankind\u201d and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from Earth.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone behaves in a completely unbelievable way. Yeah, it looks okay so let\u2019s remove the helmets for instance? Right, apart from the immediate danger to your own health, what about quarantine procedures\u2026idiots?\r\n\r\nWhy did the robot put the mutagen in the drink? It\u2019s just illogical and never really adequately explained. Speaking of robots, robots have a power source and it\u2019s not spread all over them. If you rip their head of they do not continue to talk like nothing had happened. In the original Alien they at least had to hook him up to something. It goes on. The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. \r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. What a joke. Apart from the fact that Elizabeth\u2019s actions are just ridiculous, how does she expect to live on a alien ship without food or any other supplies?\r\n\r\nThis film had good promise. The idea of getting to know the origin of the aliens intrigued me and the basic plot idea was cool. However, the film was really ruined by a script obviously written by total morons."

Music is by Lucas Vidal and cinematography by Uta Briesewitz.\r\n\r\nDetroit falls dark and silent and people are disappearing into thin air. A tiny group of survivors \"exist\"...\r\n\r\nWell it went down like a lead balloon! Critics and horror fans alike can't find much to like about it. It's certainly a tricky film to have confidence in recommending to anyone, for it's a bit short on answers and scares, sort of? However, considering the budget there's some technical guile here, and if giving the makers some credit, there's possibly intelligence of thought in the writing as well. Religio observations, a sly incorporation of the Roanoke colony disappearance and an existential undercurrent.\r\n\r\nYet it's such a frustrating picture, especially if you are a fan of Anderson's best works, or even if you rock up expecting the scarer that the adverts and plot synopsis' suggested. Cast are by the numbers wasted due to being hamstrung by the plot's attempt at blending chills with deeper thought, rendering the characterisations as unfleshed, while the ending feels like a cheat of unfinished business.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm glad I didn't pay at the cinema to see it, but with that comes the fact that in my darkened living room the other night I enjoyed it to a point. But here's a thing, it probably needs a second viewing for it to breathe better, but I'm not sure I could ever sit through it again... 6/10"

It\u2019s enjoyable, it\u2019s well casted and it\u2019s cute without being too cheesy. It\u2019s also the third miss in a row for Pixar.\r\n\r\nMU, just like Brave (and unlike Cars 2) is filled with merit, and well worth watching. But in 1995 when Pixar came out swinging with Toy Story, people expect that sort of a trend to continue. Which it did! Right up until 2006, when they released their seventh film (Cars); the first film they\u2019d gotten behind that didn\u2019t blow audiences world wide out of the Goddamn water. Pixar\u2019s limped up and down the approval ladder ever since, with MU sitting comfortably somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is a great film. Especially for a kids\u2019 film, especially for a prequel, all of that, but it is not the return to greatness audiences keep hoping for. It plays it safe, it lulls in the dreary, rarely well-pulled-off format of \u201cCollege Comedy\u201d (which is again, a safe area to sit in). It may not be as triumphant as the original, but it\u2019s not all together disappointing either.\r\nThe film does what virtually any film with large amount of money behind it does: It stands in front of you for an hour and a half, does its job in the entertainment industry of \u201centertaining\u201d you, then it sidles out, leaving you smiling, but not thoroughly satisfied. It takes as few risks as possible, and vehemently avoids anything new, just in case it pisses people off, and risks not making their money back.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s fine, people of the world are used to this, it\u2019s a fun ride, and then it\u2019s done. Worth your money, worth your time, but not what people have come to expect from the powerhouse of Pixar\u2019s heyday. \r\n\r\n74%\r\n\r\n-Gimly"

            "review": " It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about \"nothing new on the table\" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that \"haunt\" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\r\n\r\nForget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\r\n\r\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the clich\u00e9 conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls \u2013 breath holding games of hide and seek \u2013 to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\r\n\r\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10\r\n"

I mean, please, this film could be a lesson all on its own on how not to write a decent screenplay. Its all in here: one-dimensional characters, supremely poor pacing, multiple threads that go absolutely nowhere and completely implausible action sequences.\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, it's just a B-thriller. It's not like I haven't seen these mistakes time and time again. What really bothers me is just how highly it thinks of itself. It not only thinks it's interesting (which it isn't whatsoever), but it thinks it's smart, edgy, and it probably even thinks it's clever. I mean, there are so many characters who function for exactly one plot point and are then left behind in the dust. For example, this one chick who's name I forget (did they ever even say her name?) is introduced fairly early on in the film, and looks even like Russell Crowe's love interest. We see the very, very beginnings of a meaningful relationship forming and then it turns out that she was only a device to fill in a little potential plot hole (trying not to spoil the movie.) The same with Russell Crowe's parents, there are a handful of scattered scenes with them showing little glimpses of a meaningful relationship, and then the same exact friggin' thing is done, they're used as a simple (and illogical) plot mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt's almost like one of Paul Haggis's friends was reading the script and said \"hey, Paul, this is completely ridiculous, how could they possibly manage to _________\" and Haggis wrote in these characters as devices to satisfy the issue, realized they were one-dimensional, and wrote in a pseudo-intelligent relationship (which doesn't in reality make them any better.) And this is how the first 2/3 of the movie moves so dreadfully slowly. I mean, I'm absolutely confident that with a decent editor, the first hour and fifteen minutes could be whittled down to maybe half an hour.\r\n\r\nThey could have especially left out the symbols that don't actually symbolize anything. Which seems silly to say, but the jar of quarters that keeps recurring in the movie not only has no plot significance, but has zero metaphorical significance. They barely explained what they were doing in their house. They were quite literally only in the film to make it look a little deeper. Not to make it more meaningful, but to make it look more meaningful. To make it \"smart,\" and \"edgy,\" and \"clever.\" I don't usually have a problem with making it through a movie but I had to push to make it through this ludicrous, self-righteous mess."

However, it doesn't quite come together cohesively enough to be enjoyed on a major level.\r\n\r\nI didn't dislike <em>'Dream House'</em>, I found it alright to be honest. Craig (Will), as alluded to, is enjoyable in the main role, with Rachel Weisz (Libby) and Naomi Watts (Ann) being solid supports. The casting is probably the best thing about this film. It's the execution of the plot that holds it back.\r\n\r\nWhat's produced is watchable, but doesn't - at least for me - connect on any hearty level. The final act is a little clunky and messy, despite a nice reveal earlier on in the 84 minutes . It's definitely an interesting concept, but it's mostly a wasted one by the end. Reportedly, along with director John Sheridan, Craig and Weisz disagreed with the producer's final cut - no blame to them, if so.\r\n\r\nCraig, the idea and the run time stops this leaving a negative memory. I likely won't revisit it, but it's an OK - if underwhelming - production."

CJ Adams gives a respectable and sweet performance as Timothy, while Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton bring the heart in their roles as Cindy and James. The other characters are absolutely terrible, I will say that - especially Rosemarie DeWitt's Brenda.\r\n\r\nWhat it severely lacks in a supporting cast, it makes up for with its hearty narrative and nicely paced story. I don't think it's perfect or anything close, but it brings the feels that it intended to bring. Definitely worth a watch."

            "review": "> Half movie, half documentary, the story of most crucial scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe film was inspired by the real life stories of the two women from the same timeline who had no connections, except theirs involvement with something. That means there are two sets of stories that's told one after another in parts which covered the events from nearly the three decades. So it all begins in the 1960, where two little sisters promise to each other about something, but 10 years later one of their's life changed forever when another one dies of cancer. So this is the story where the other sister begins her fight against the disease that took her family away.\r\n\r\nThis is a small budget film that shot entirely within a month of time. There are lots of actresses in this, even for the small roles. I thought Helen Hunt would lead the narration, but then there were Maggie Grace, Alice Eve, Aaron Paul and others. Great dedications by all, but this was Samantha Morton's film.\r\n\r\nI did not know what this story is about when I decided to watch, but I'm pretty happy for the film. Except the material was more a documentary suitable kind, especially the story of Helen Hunt's character. Moreover feels like it is a short film with a decent story. I think it is worth a watch because of unfolding an important scientific discovery of our time. So a big yes on that perspective, but entertainment wise it is just an average. Now you can decide this on what you're seeking.\r\n\r\n7/10"

They start over in southwestern Ohio and John insists on going to high school where he meets a special girl (Dianna Agron). Callan McAuliffe is on hand as a notorious geek at school while Teresa Palmer plays a mystery woman whose identity is revealed in the last act.\r\n\r\n\u201cI Am Number Four\u201d (2011) was based on the book by Pittacus Lore (aka James Frey & Jobie Hughes). I never heard of the flick until stumbling upon it on streaming. It turns out that this was a fairly big production, costing $60 million and being produced by Michael Bay. \r\n\r\nDirected by D.J. Caruso, the film starts out too busy, like it\u2019s in a rush, not to mention there\u2019s zero subtlety about the nature of the protagonists and their extraterrestrial-oriented dilemma. But the flick soon finds its footing once the setting switches to Ohio and John goes to school. This, of course, brings to mind \u201cTwilight\u201d (2008), but \u201cI Am Number Four\u201d is way more ballsy. Yes, it\u2019s comic booky, but who cares? It delivers the goods as sci-fi drama/action.\r\n\r\nThe creativity turned my head on a few occasions and when Teresa Palmer shows up in the final act, it\u2019s all the better. Then there\u2019s the cute dog with a revelation. Unfortunately, there was never a sequel even though the ending lays the groundwork. While the movie made $55 million domestically and $150 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment. The fools.      \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in southwestern Pennsylvania as follows: Monaca (Sam\u2019s house), Murrysville (high school), Beaver & Beaver Falls (the falls, etc.), McKeesport (house party & police car scenes), Vandergrift (street light explodes), Harmony (cemetery scene) and Pittsburgh. The opening was shot in Islamorada, Florida, with a scene or two done in Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.\r\n\r\nDespite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).\r\n\r\nThe best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likeable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film!\r\n\r\nMost of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.\r\n\r\nIt's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status/settling in nicely behind Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.\r\n\r\nFor more reviews, visit www.ireviewfilms.com"

            "review": "Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years and\u0085little known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.\r\n\r\nAnd like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?\r\n\r\nBut all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.\r\n\r\nWhere the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nThere's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective.\r\n\r\nThe movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with \"There's Something About Mary\", just with not as good a payoff.\r\n\r\nHannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though.\r\n\r\nThe women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels.\r\n\r\nSo I go 6 out of 10 on this one.

There are loads of great sci-fi films were made recently and still coming out. So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.\r\n\r\nThe story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable. But I warn the grownups, stay away, or be like them while watching it, in order to get entertained.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"

Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.\r\n\r\nThe original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.\r\n\r\nRenee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.\r\n\r\nThis is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well. So choosing it to watch is not a bad idea.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

I'm usually writing reviews on the old classics, or the old obscure films, so this is unusual for me.  But I was astounded after viewing this little treasure, to discover a modern movie that I would enjoy and give a high rating.\r\n\r\nKevin Costner provides the voice of Enzo, and does it perfectly, giving the character warmth, intelligence, confidence, and a touch of humor.  \r\n\r\nThis is a great family movie, or for those who just like a good, warmhearted dog story.  While I don't personally agree with the reincarnation theology presented here, it's a work of fiction anyways.  And no movie ever ended with a better song for the end credits, so totally in keeping with the themes inherent in the film, Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\"."

It stars Jodie Whittaker, John Boyega, Alex Esmail, Jumayn Hunter, Luke Treadaway and Nick Frost. Music is by Basement Jaxx and Steven Price and cinematography by Tom Townend.\r\n\r\nWhen a South London tower block comes under attack from aliens, a young gang of lads and the nurse they just mugged have to band together to fight back.\r\nIn Britain we was wondering just when Joe Cornish was going to turn his hand to directing a feature film, here for his debut he tackled a sci-fiction action comedy with a wry bit of social commentary thrown in for good measure \u2013 it was worth the wait.\r\n\r\nWith one Edgar Wright hovering about in the producers lounge and Nick Frost on hand as a reassuringly adult comedic presence, it could be argued that Attack the Block has joined the Wright/Pegg production line. Yet when you break it down this does in fact homage a myriad of siege invasion films, but still it becomes very much its own animal.\r\n\r\nCornish dangerously structures his film by introducing us to a young gang of kids who think nothing of mugging a single defenceless woman \u2013 with a knife. With the group spouting their turf speak (some none British views may struggle initially with the dialogue), they are not a bunch of youngsters one can easily get on side with. In fact to dislike them in an instant is wholly justifiable and understandable, so much so that once the aliens arrive it\u2019s a human reaction to root for them to rid us of these troublesome youths. So yes, dangerous by Cornish, yet astute as it happens.\r\n\r\nAs the pic progresses and we spend time with the gang, we start to understand their way of life, their part in a tough society. It\u2019s during this key phase that Cornish brings in another structure, that of the victim and the perpetrators having to band together to fight an enemy, surely he isn\u2019t going to make heroes out of this gang of youthful miscreants? So once this scene is set, and the aliens start to unleash toothsome hell on this part of South London, it\u2019s battle royale time. The blood and jokes seamlessly flow together, the score booms and other characters are introduced, some either for a lighter angle \u2013 others to annoy us and maybe be set up for alien gnasher fodder?\r\n\r\nThe aliens themselves are a splendid creation, a new addition to an overstocked market. One of the youngsters calls them gorilla wolf things, that\u2019s about right, they be jet black with spiky hair and bio luminescent jaws and claws, they move on all fours. And then it\u2019s the last part of Cornish\u2019s clever structure plan, for as we are given a reason why the aliens are after this particular group, so does characters transformations offer a prudent point. There is hope unbound, not just for people in movie, but for societies fractured by the way of the life afforded them. While the lesson here of people taking responsibility for their actions, to right their wrongs, is written loud and proud.\r\n\r\nSmart and fresh performances  across the board, led by the wonderful Whittaker and a star making turn from Boyega, close out the deal. Attack the Block is a genre spilcer of a picture that brings something new to the table it sits at. Trust Bruv!   8/10"

            "review": "I really enjoyed this Cronenberg film. Though my favourite films of his\r\nare the incredible ones he did in my teens, during the 80's\r\n('Videodrome', 'The Dead Zone' and 'The Fly' are nothing short of\r\noutstanding, and works that no one else could have come up with), he's\r\nreally been thinking outside of the box for the past decade (even for a\r\nconsistently interesting creature such as he), and it's only been\r\nrecently, with both Sarah Polley and Denis Villeneuve emerging as vital\r\ndirectors, that his ranking as the greatest Canadian director ever has\r\neven had suitable competition for comparison.\r\n\r\nI remembered when this came out, and I believe a critic from 'The Globe\r\nand Mail' interviewed Cronenberg at its opening at Cannes, and he was\r\nalmost apologetic about using Pattinson. It sounded like he didn't want\r\nto have to direct him. He made the excuse that he couldn't get funding\r\nfor his projects from North America anymore, which is a dirty rotten\r\nshame, and had to go to Europe and Asia any time he wanted to make a\r\nfilm in order to have it bankrolled, and the Japanese insisted on star\r\npower to put moviegoers in the seats, and said there'd only be\r\nfinancial backing if Cronenberg directed Pattinson. This was my first\r\nexperience watching the actor's work, and he did a fine job, no\r\nproblem. The supporting cast was strong, with many of my favourite\r\ncharacter actors of late, such as Paul Giamatti and Jay Baruchel. The\r\nscript, co-written by Cronenberg, was a strong statement about just how\r\nout of touch the very rich are with the other 99% of us. I docked my\r\nmark by 1/10 because I was pissed off that Cronenberg degraded one of\r\nthe finest actresses of our lifetime, Juliette Binoche here. I can't\r\neven talk about it. It was as difficult for me to tolerate as Spike Lee\r\nhaving Christopher Plummer call Jodie Foster something awful in the\r\notherwise excellent 'Inside Man'. Lee's off my Christmas card list for\r\nsure this year, but Cronenberg being a fellow Canadian (I bet you\r\nthought I was going to say white, hahaha), I'll be less angry. But he\r\nbetter look over his shoulder if he tries something like THAT again. I\r\nwas THAT close to crossing HIM off my Christmas card list too...\r\n\r\nI also remember from the time the film came out, an article and rating\r\non the film (I think it was 'The Globe and Mail' as well, and by the\r\nsame critic who had earlier interviewed him), saying that when he\r\nwatched it, he watched a few teenage girls leaving the theatre (most\r\nprobably because Pattinson was in it), saying it was the worst movie\r\nthey had ever seen. That's the only evidence you need that this is a\r\nfine movie, well worth your time."

It stars John Cusack, Luke Evans, Alice Eve and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by Lucas Vidal and cinematography by Danny Ruhlmann.\r\n\r\n\"On October 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found, near death, on a park bench in Baltimore, Maryland. The last days of his life remain a mystery\"\r\n\r\nIt's a real smart idea that the makers have here, putting their own theory forward on what happened in the lead up to Poe's death. Essentially a period whodunit procedural as Poe (Cusack) and Inspector Emmett Fields (Evans) race against time to find the person who is killing in the style of Poe's literary works. Poe's love interest, Emily Hamilton (Eve), is in grave danger, so as to add extra peril and suspense into the clock ticking drama.\r\n\r\nIt's a safe piece of entertainment, one that acquaints the uninitiated with Poe's work and his life struggles away from the writing bureau. The detective angle is fun and the murders grizzly and appropriately Gothic in execution. Unfortunately it rarely convinces as a period piece. The dialogue is often out of sync with the era, Eve is miscast, the score is inappropriate and it always feels like actors playing at period rompery. \r\n\r\nIt's a shame that it is bogged down by such irritants because Teague's direction is stylish, while the art design deserves a round of applause. Cusack is fun to watch, but more at ease playing Sherlock in the second half of the piece than a tortured soul in the first, and Evans is confident in the straight backed gentleman detective stakes. There's a good time to be had here on a surface whodunit follow the clues experience, and Poe fans will delight at catching the many references to his life and spiky works, but it unfortunately misses the mark in too many key areas. 6/10"

Though the story is not fresh enough. In fact, it is comparable to the recent sports-biopic, I mean that came much later to this, 'Eddie the Eagle'. Looks even the filmed location was same. Quite similar theme when it comes to the sporting events, but there's a wide gap on how it was played and by whom.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'All about Steve'. Firstly, it was a sport film and then romance attached to it in the required opening slot. So pretty inspiring to focus on something in our life to reach the heights. There's no shortcuts, it's always a hard work. In the film, that concept was funnily told. Encountering a new world, and discovering new things. It includes friendship, love and dedication in what one believes in.\r\n\r\nGreat cast, except the love interest of Felicity Jones. He wasn't bad, but the chemistry did not work, even in the short span of their romance in the tale. Anyway, the romance parts were too clich\u00e9, but neglectable as it has little value. Because there are other reasons to like the film. The stunts are not extraordinary, just simple and realistic. The film will work for most of the people if they're not expecting too much. This is not some chick flick, a better film than that.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"

If you've ever liked anything they've ever done (aside from \"Green Lantern\") then you'll probably like this.  Seeing them do \"impressions\" of each other is a bonus.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"body swapping\" goes, I think this is the only non-parent child, non-male female swap that I've seen, which is probably what makes it a lot of fun: there's no socio-political debate sitting in the background on single vs married, but all the fun of \"now I have to deal with THIS\".  Maybe there are some issues of how redeemable the characters are in their flaw sets, but it's built into the premise.\r\n\r\nWith Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde backing up the leads, everyone gives a stellar performance.  The production value is clearly there, though I think most of it went into locations and cast budgets: this isn't an action-car-chase movie, it's a \"body swap\" dirt humor rom com.\r\n\r\nThe writing does skew dirty in the humor, but if you have an open mind, then the humor ends up being in the surprise of dealing with each others lives unprepared.  Despite the juvenile basis of guys trying to do whatever they want, the movie is surprisingly touching and about togetherness."

This is a film about friendship, and in some respects it feels more of the same compared to other coming-of-age films, but it delivers past that expectation with the help of Olivia Wilde's excellent direction and the strength of Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein. This is a film about friendship, but it's also about a celebration of youth and empowerment of one\u2019s own life. Dever and Feldstein are perfection but Billie Lourd is hilarious as well! But seriously, it\u2019s also the hardest i\u2019ve laughed in a long time and it'll sadly probably get snubbed come awards season but this deserves Best Picture and i will love and cherish this movie until I die."

Like everything suddenly halted, the story came to an end with giving clich\u00e9d reason. Though the actors were amazing, and many jokes were awesome. The lead two combination was among the best Kevin Hart worked so far like in the recently with Ice Cube and Will Ferrell.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes set off the tone for the rest of the film. Twenty years later, an adventure begins, but that part was so familiar, except the influence of the opening part that carried till the final scene. Even though slightly unpredictable scenes, because the diversions were neatly done against what viewers could expect. The focus was largely on the lead pair, so theirs undertaking was kind of faded away.\r\n\r\nThere's a guest role at the end, also some behind the scene clips during the end credit cheers us. I think it is a good comedy than it looks, but definitely not the best. Its not the narration, but the actors that makes worth a watch. The stunt sequences were just okay, but utilised according to what the story required. Overall, an enjoyable, time pass film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"
