Try watching those now. Maybe there are one or two funny scenes in each of those overrated films. _Movie 43_ has many laugh-out-loud moments. It's a bunch of short skits like the over-hyped _Kentucky Fried Movie_ but unlike that steaming pile, this is well crafted. Also, there are two versions of this. The little thread of a story between the skits is different depending on the version you watch. I think it got bad reviews because of ultra sensitive, politically correct critics. People really need to lighten up. 9/10 stars."

Well, as it turned out after having watched it I feel that my expectations was not entirely fulfilled. It is a decent enough movie. Certainly enjoyable to watch. But it is, in my opinion, not a great move and I cannot give it more than an average okay rating.\r\n\r\nI have not read the original story which the movie is, supposedly, based nor seen any of the other 47 Ronin movies that have been made. Thus I did not really know what the story was except what was the public storyline nor do I know if the movie actually follows the original story in any great detail. The basic story in the movie is a good one though. Classic, simple and perhaps not very original but a good concept for making a good adventure movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is entertaining\u2026to an extent. There are plenty of nice scenes, action, special effects that all make the movie worthwhile to watch. The Japanese, samurai, setting is one that is not used very often in major movies except of course for a bunch of fairly ludicrous martial arts movies which cater for a rather limited audience and generally on a very low-budget.\r\n\r\nHowever, I never really felt much attachment to any of the characters. Even the half-breed, which are supposed to be the hero, never seemed to lift above the ordinary. The bad guy could have been any two-bit crook in a TV-show. The witch was a bit better but still rather meh. The Shogun at least provoked a bit of emotions but not in a good way. What an asshole! Not a shred of investigation when Lord Asano was bewitched. Just \u201cgo kill yourself\u201d. Then after the 47 Ronins had actually proven his innocence as well as proven themselves to be the most loyal and capable warriors around the dumb fuck wants them killed because they disobeyed his orders which where total nonsense from the start. As a matter of fact, the ending dragged down the movie quite a lot for me.\r\n\r\nStill a movie worth watching but it could have been a lot better."

Out of what is clearly a massive homage to _Judgement Day_, _Genisys_ gives away the entire plot and central \u201ctwist\u201d in its promotional material months before its release, just like _Judgement Day_ did!\r\n\r\nAll levity aside, _Terminator: Genisys_ is not great. They took some risks with their casting and it didn\u2019t explode in their face which is nice, a lot of the effects were very visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again, but these aren\u2019t things that make a good movie by themselves. When you mix them up with a plot that doesn\u2019t completely make sense, a story that\u2019s just plain not all that great, some hammy dialogue and a lacklustre ending, then you SPOIL YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE IN THE TRAILERS **AND** POSTERS, then you\u2019re lucky to even be coming away with a middle of the road score like this one.\r\n\r\nAt least it\u2019s not _Rise of the Machines_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating: \u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

George Smiley (Gary Oldman), having been fired from the Circus, has now been rehired (secretly) to find the mole. He assembles his small team and begins to look into the matters. The possibilities are plenty, Percy (Toby Jones), Esterhase (David Dencik), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Bill Haydon (Colin Firth). His old friend, Control (John Hurt), even suspected George himself of being the mole.\r\n\r\nThis movie is directed by a personal favorite of mine, Tomas Alfredson, who also created the vampire movie, _Let the Right One In_ (Lad den rette komme ind), as well as the amazing, _Four Shades of Brown_ (fire nuancer af brun). He is a master of creating a dark and mysterious atmosphere, and does exactly that in this movie. The pace is slow, the music is scarce and the colours are old and faded, perfect for a spy movie such as this.\r\n\r\nWatching this movie is like watching a puzzle being carefully put together in front of you. It takes time to get it just right, and you have to look carefully at all the pieces. Good things takes time, and this movie understands that. The viewer has to watch carefully, because it constantly goes from the present and into the past. People who have died, are resurrected in the memories of the past, to help us construct the final image.\r\n\r\n_Last words... this movie will not appeal to everyone, it requires the viewer to be active, watch carefully, and to appreciate the slow narrative. I will gladly admit that I have tried watching this movie three times before I finally succeeded in watching all of it. I am not normally a fan of these sort of movies, but I can always appreciate spectacular acting, and the craftmanship of a truly great director, and so, this movie becomes so much more than just a spy movie. It becomes a movie about people living on the edge of a war, trying to survive, trying to find the one threat that might break down the wall and destroy the british empire._"

Everything about it draws enormous attention to what you would expect to be happening and not doing it.  Trust me, I understand that subversion of expectation is comedy, but there is a rate of diminishing returns on the repetition and duration of the joke, and if you play with that line, then you're writing a comedy for comedy writers because they are the only ones that are going to look at the movie / life as a punchline, and I don't think that is what they were going for.\r\n\r\nThere is an underlying theme of patience and adaptability: life will even out even in the roughest of situations, but the movie just sort of stops without even an epilogue, they're just literally and suddenly not there anymore.\r\n\r\nI think there is a lot to get out of the movie, if you're strong enough to reach for it: a man who has everything but doesn't give you what you need isn't as good a man who has almost nothing and wants to give you what you need.  It's a counter argument to \"Nice guys finish last\".\r\n\r\nPlease don't waste your time, go watch anything else Paul Rudd has been in except for the one where he buys a French villa."

The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms\u2014it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect."

Story has Moore as a successful doctor who suspects her husband is being unfaithful with his younger students. Hiring a prostitute to pose as a student and catch him in the act, it sets in wheels the motions of untapped passions and deadly emotions.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit Hitchcock lite in truth, but the strength of the cast list always keeps the story interesting. The key turns in the plot are to be taken with a pinch of salt, but Egoyan and his team keep things ethereal as the tech credits are splendidly mounted. A safe and solid erotic thriller, even if it's more low-rent than high-grade. 6/10"

In the 80s when the drug trafficking was so high in the United States that came from the Latin America through the southern border, the US customs service sent its members to infiltrate among them to bust red handed. So this is one of the events where a married man with two children takes a most challenging assignment that might end up badly if he makes a single mistake. In such a tight spot how he and his team are going to achieve the one of a biggest crack in the history revealed in the remaining.\r\n\r\nSo now we know the story, but this is not an easy game. There are many scenes that would pull you to the edge of your seat. After the wonderful performance in 'Trumbo' that got him an Academy Awards nominee last year, now he's back with another great character display. I'm talking about Bryan Cranson. Another Oscar's nod is quite possible in a second year row, but lets wait and see. This story mainly focused on him, but John Leguizamd was also impressive in an important supporting role and so the Diane Kruger.\r\n\r\nI think it was a most realistic undercover film among others I have seen. The drugs were not shown much and so the sex and nudes, despite the plot revolved around that. Even the stunts were minimised, but those rare action sequences were so good. The majority of the film was drama with lots of thrill scenes. The two hours long film, and the story were narrated with a good pace.

Two people (Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt)  are stranded on a malfunctioning starship over which they have little control.  At first they can divert themselves with all the material wealth at their disposal.  But when one commits a crime against the other, there is no society and no judicial system that can handle the offense.  How can they work it out the ethics of punishment, penance, and rehabilitation between them?\r\n\r\nThe movie is marred by some scenes that look impressive but aren't scientifically accurate, particularly where gravity is concerned.  Probably added by studio suits who wanted to wow the audience but didn't understand or care about the underlying science.  But that's par for the course for most science fiction movies."

God help us all. \r\n\r\nBlack Mass is the story of Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), who was the brother of a state senator and the infamous violent leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang. It charts his criminal activities and his subsequent dealings with the FBI.\r\n\r\nDirected by Scott Cooper, Black Mass is one of those instances where a great lead performance deserves a better over all film. Depp literally inhabits the role of Bulger in a fully formed perf that reminds us of what a fine actor he can be. Unfortunately the edgy material to hand never really ignites in filmic form. Maybe we were spoilt by the offerings of Coppola and Scorsese previously? For this comes off as a cheap imitation of far greater films, with the crafters of the pic giving us something of a caricature piece.\r\n\r\nAlthough compelling as a lead character study, much of the narrative is rendered as playing it safe, putting emotive heart where it doesn't belong. Most of the support characters, and key to the story, are under developed, while the pace is decidedly attention sapping and not adroitly understated. Nevertheless, we do get good acting perfs to support Depp, notably Joel Edgerton as corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while Masanobu Takayanagi's (Hostiles) cinematography is delicate of moody hues.\r\n\r\nThere's a fascinating story trying to get out of this, but the 15 year wait to get it to screen hasn't been worth it. There's some truly electric scenes, but they are few and far between, which gives us ultimately just a compact and safe piece of gangster film making. 5/10"

Follows the journey of Agu as he's forced to join a group of soldiers. While Agu fears his commander and many of the men around him, his fledgling childhood has been brutally shattered by the war raging through his country, and he is at first torn between conflicting revulsion and fascination. Depicts the mechanics of war and does not shy away from explicit, visceral detail, painting a complex, difficult picture of Agu as a child soldier.",

You stay locked up long enough and you start to believe that you're nuts.\r\n\r\nAfter a gap of nine years, horror legend John Carpenter returned to the movie screen directors chair for this solid if unspectacular horror movie. Though some of the critical reactions to it stink of an over expectation for a return to his former glories, the plain fact is that it's just safe horror film making. \r\n\r\nPlot finds Amber Heard (The Stepfather/All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) as troubled arsonist Kristen. Shunted into a mental institution post haste, Kristen finds herself menaced by a violent ghost that seems intent on ridding the ward of all its female inhabitants. \r\n\r\nAnd there you have it, a bunch of hopelessly pretty girls (seriously, are all institutionalised girls good looking babes?) are stalked and killed by a female spirit who is dressed up in poor rubbery make up. The odd boo-jump comes and goes, making it not a complete dead loss on the scare front, while the cast are solid in performances and Carpenter shows some trade mark camera techniques to make certain scenes pulse with anxiety. It then hurries along to the big reveal, which sadly disappoints because it just comes off as something done far better in horror/thriller films previously. It was easy money for Carpenter, and us acolytes don't begrudge him that, while it isn't the embarrassment some have made it out to be, but it is average fare and not a great way for JC to bow out from horror movie making - director wise that is. 6/10"

            "review": "One thing is for certain: no one can accuse director Burr Steers\u2019s off-kilter version of novelist Jane Austen\u2019s lyrical literary landscape **Pride and Prejudice** as being deemed solely melancholy and manipulative. The challenge of presenting a sophisticated and sudsy exposition while incorporating the ghoulish gimmicky of zombies to elevate the surrealism and cynicism of the British-based costume drama is an ambitious taking to say the least. Thankfully, Steers delivers a halfway decent piercing period piece that accentuates both the elegance and eeriness of Austen\u2019s blossomed universe of early 19th century English femininity dripping with refined defiance and desire. Hence, Steers\u2019s somewhat choppy but inspired **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** provides an imaginative and slightly insane spin on the austere exuberance of Austen\u2019s classic romancer highlighted with the butt-kicking antics of the bombastic Bennett sisters.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that movie and television audiences throughout the years have been subjected to the omnipresence of the Jane Austen Experience through countless interpretations of her treasured **Pride and Prejudice** artistic works. For the most part, the radiance of Pride and Prejudice has always maintained its ravishing romanticism in the various incarnations showcased. However, Steers looks to promote a bloody-thirsty blueprint and enhance the urgent sense of Austen\u2019s femme fatale movement\u2013in this case unite the Bennett brood and arm them with the alertness of sinister-made sisterhood. Instinctively, the premise for **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** gives off a bizarre but refreshing vibe when distributing its wacky brand of subversive feminine liberation.\r\n\r\nAusten heroine Elizabeth Bennett has always been possessed in her personalized convictions especially when it came to love and stability. Nevertheless, **Zombies\u2019** Liz (Lily James) has a mission in mind that does not necessarily involve finding that ideal suitor of choice. In this case, Elizabeth and her sisters Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia (Bella Heathcoate, Mille Brasy, Suki Waterhouse and Ellie Bamber) are the sisterly slayers trained to eradicate the unwanted walking dead. The Bennett beauties, all skilled at exceptional swordplay courtesy of intensified training in China, are looked down upon within their elite social circles. Furthermore, the concern over the feisty Elizabeth and her siblings finding their soulmates rests on the shoulders of their worrisome parents Mr. and Mrs. Bennett (Charles Dance and Sally Phillips). What is to become of the vast Bennett estate should their offspring not find the eligible companions to continue the bloodline? The question remains: will the bashing Bennett babes go down in family history as courageous zombie huntresses  or suffer the societal humiliation as available spinsters untouched?\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s preference is to be vigilant in her quest to zap out the zombie presence whenever possible as opposed to obsessing over whether she will hook the grand love of her life. Still, the very idea of meeting Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) at one of the festive balls may have at least humbled the combative Elizabeth a bit and had her entertain the notion of embracing a romantic feeling. Unfortunately duty calls and the agenda for terminating the pesky zombies as they invade the region is the top priority for Bennett brigade.\r\n\r\nActually, **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a frenetic fable that solidly works because it is able to competently marry two ubiquitous genres\u2013zombie B-movies with prim and proper Austen period piece adaptations\u2013and come up with a quirky and contentious commentary on female-oriented resistance and rage. Steers rips into the convention of womanhood wonderment with a horror flick romancer that has its sheer of nuanced nerve and chilly-minded charm. The gory shenanigans and showy execution of Zombies\u2019  cinematic makeup from Remy Adefarasin\u2019s luscious cinematography to David Warren\u2019s production design and Julian Day\u2019s costume designs all mesh with noted symmetry. The balance of wit, suspense, terror and tirade as the Bennett bunch and their suitors engage in swagger as they eliminate the detestable zombies feels delectable in manufactured naughtiness.\r\n\r\nThe performances are steady and give substance to the welcomed wackiness that uncannily defines this effectively compelling but twisted treat to Austen\u2019s pretty protagonists dressed up in gorgeous gowns that conceal their blood-laced daggers. As the lead Bennett sister, James is rather engrossing as the impulsive sword-swinging sass as her unique spin on Austen\u2019s curly-haired creation is as credible and creative as say Keira Knightley\u2019s stamp on the Elizabeth Bennett role.  Although rollicking in a zombie B-movie without relying too much on the crutch of high stakes camp, James and her supporting players are quite poised to go with the flow based on what the unpredictable material hands them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a serviceable spectacle that dares to weave a Victorian-cultured social class romance yarn with an undead creepfest while finding a common ground in the hidden psyche of the young woman\u2019s destined determination for self-discovery. Perhaps introducing the less literate crowd to Jane Austen\u2019s brand of high class sensibilities through the battling Bennetts during the onslaught of an English countryside zombie invasion would make other future **Pride and Prejudice** installments feel more renewed and receptive.\r\n\r\n**Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr, 49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcoate, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith, Charles Dance, Sally Phillips, Suki Waterhouse, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady\r\n\r\nDirected by: Burr Steers\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Fantasy\u2019Romance and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016"

But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A."

            "review": "Doogtooth, the official Greek entry to the 2011 Academy Awards, is nominated for Best Foreign Film.  Released in 2009, and directed by Giorgos Lanthimos, Dogtooth is a strikingly original film that captures a world that is at once like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen, but oddly familiar at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe story is about a family of five who live in a beautiful walled villa in Greece.  It\u2019s more like a compound because the patriarch (Christos Stergioglou) is the only one who ever gets to venture into the world beyond the tall fences that surround the property.  His wife (Michele Valley) and three teenaged children live in a world that at first seems oddly Edenic.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with the children listening to an instructional cassette.  They learn that the word \u201csea\u201d means a leather armchair, \u201cmotorway\u201d means a strong wind, and \u201cexcursion\u201d means a strong, resilient material.  Anything that hints at the world outside the walls of their home is obscured.  Even the airplanes that fly in the air are construed to be toys, and when one is spotted, one of the parents will run into the house and through a toy plane out into the garden so the children will believe the lie.\r\n\r\nThe only outsider allowed into the compound is a woman named Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou), a security guard at the father\u2019s place of employment who moonlights as a kind of private prostitute whom the father hires to satisfy his son\u2019s budding sexual urges.  Christina is brought to the compound blindfolded, but on the rides to and from the family home, the father tries to engage her in small talk, which amounts to questions about her hygiene, and whether she wears the perfume he has bought her as a gift.\r\n\r\nMuch time is devoted to daily routine of the family.\r\n\r\nWe see the father at work, where he has created yet another elaborate ruse to get out of having his boss over for dinner (he says that his wife, a former handball champion, is confined to a wheel chair \u2013 the result of a tragic accident).  He\u2019s such a cipher of a man that the boss, along with the children, buys into the lie without a hint of suspicion.\r\n\r\nLife at home, though, is where the film really shines.  We see the kids at play.  The eldest child is the son (Hristos Passalis), who looks to be 18 or 19.  Two sisters (Angelika Papoulia and Mary Toni) look to be 18 and 17.  Though they are on the verge of adulthood, the behavior of the children is more pre-adolescent.  There is an innocence about them that is both sad and endearing.  The actors playing the kids beautifully capture the behavior and mental territory of young kids that comes through in the games they play and the way they bicker with one another and depend on their parents for all their information about the world \u2013 a world they will only be ready to experience when either their left or right dogtooth falls out.\r\n\r\nWhat is a dogtooth?  Exactly.\r\n\r\nWhen the son asks the mother what a zombie is, she asks where he heard the word.  He lies and says that he thinks he heard the father say the word.  The mother pauses, then tells him a zombie is a small yellow flower.  Later, the joke is paid off when the son stops in the middle of his play in the garden and yells for the mother to come and see two zombies he\u2019s found.\r\n\r\nTricking children is one thing, but as they grow, certain fantasies and myths that parents create are found out to be lies.  Of course, this often happens when our kids come home with conflicting information from the outside world, which is what happens to make the artificial world of the father begin to unravel.\r\n\r\nChristina, the prostitute, wants oral sex, which the son doesn\u2019t like, so she bribes the oldest daughter into satisfying her by bringing videos, like Rocky and Flashdance, that give the daughter a notion of what goes on in the world her father has taught her to fear.\r\n\r\nThese videos are like the bite from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and even though the father finds out about them and banishes both them and Christina from their lives, the damage has been done.  Things will never be the same again.\r\n\r\nThe acting in Dogtooth is beautifully realized.\r\n\r\nStergioglou doesn\u2019t play the father as a tyrant, but as a kind, loving, but firm parent, with only the best interests of his family \u2013 as he sees them \u2013 in mind.  This father, despite what happens in the movie, never comes across as a villain, which is to Stergioglou\u2019s great credit.\r\n\r\nThe children, especially Papoulia and Tsoni, capture a prolonged innocence that doesn\u2019t rely on tricks or costuming, but on finely observed performances.  What\u2019s weird is that these are very damaged people, but until they are told so or try to live in the outside world, they\u2019re just kids.\r\n\r\nBecause of how perfectly Lanthimos sets up this alternate world, I never once questioned anything that went on there.  It all made sense.  Dogtooth is a well constructed escape that takes a long, hard look at family and parenting and the choices we sometimes make as parents to both lock out the world and lock in our kids \u2013 and the toll those decisions sometimes take.  Sometimes sad, sometimes funny, Dogtooth is a film deserving of its nomination \u2013 and your attention."

            "review": "Summertime 2016 has not been very kind to DC Comics-based personalities looking to shine consistently like their big screen Marvel Comics counterparts. Following the super-sized dud that was _Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_ released a few months ago must really put some major pressure on Warner Bros. to gamble on ensuring that the presence of **Suicide Squad** does not meet the same kind of indifferent reception. Well, it turns out that although the anticipation was high for writer-director David Ayer's supervillain saga involving high-powered imprisoned rogues recruited as U.S. governmental operatives out to stop other skillful baddies (as it was for Zack Ryder's aforementioned \"Dawn of Justice\") the concoction of **Suicide Squad** feels like a colorful mishmash of collective misfits laboriously taking up space in a disjointed eye candy-coated spectacle that never manages to match its intended sizzle.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the premise for **Suicide Squad** would tap into the intriguing naughtiness with more robust gumption given the collection of super-powered oddballs asked to be immediate anti-heroes in this toothless jamboree of renegade rejects. Strangely, the grim and brooding presentation of **Suicide Squad** is more of an erratic downer than a hyperactive high-wire act as intended at the creative hands of Ayer. There is no reason why this lively group of adventurous agitators should appear so flat and inconsequential in a boisterous blockbuster that sporadically limps.\r\n\r\nGiven the twisted members that comprise this elite team of terrorizing tools it is very disappointing to see how **Suicide Squad** struggles with its so-called subversive themes. Sadly, this splattered mess never firmly grasps its bid for distinctive irreverence or off-balance exploitation. Instead, **Squad** feels strained in its execution and we are never really invested in entirely watching these treasured troublemakers find redemption because the story is soggy and uninspired. Furthermore, not all of the **Squad** participants are fleshed out satisfyingly for us to get behind with thirsty cynicism. The headlining leads in Will Smith's Floyd Lawton/Deadshot, Oscar-winner Jared Leto's green-haired Joker and Australian beauty Margot Robbie's Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn get the meaty standout parts while the lesser known supporting cast get stuck with chewing on the thankless remaining bone while seemingly acting as background furniture to the bigger names.\r\n\r\nNaturally, desperation has set in for the U.S. government as they need to safeguard national security against advanced sinister forces that threaten the fiber of American self-interests everywhere. What better way to hire gifted protection than to consider employing the world's most incarcerated corruptible, cutthroat cretins to perform the dirty work in unforgivable mission ops that require death-defying determination. Enter U.S. Intelligence agent Amanda Waller (Oscar nominee Viola Davis). Waller's duties are to assemble the ragtag team known as the Suicide Squad--ominous (yet talented) jailbirds tapped to step in and assume superhero status (especially when the real superheroes are tied up in other crime-stopping affairs) while helping out for the greater good of our vulnerable society. In exchange for the Suicide Squad's sacrifice in turning from hell-bent heels to reluctant heralded heroes they are promised commuted prison sentences should they effectively defend and destroy the deadly foes out to promote heavy-handed havoc across the board.\r\n\r\nConveniently, bureaucratic bigwig Waller (through voiceover) introduces the Suicide Squad and describes what beneficial assets they bring to the turbulent table. Among the naughty notables include the well-known ace sniper Floyd Lawton/Deadshot as well as legendary lethal joy-boy Joker and his better (or perhaps worst half) in girlfriend Harley Quinn. The other toxic tag-a-longs along for the thrill ride of becoming rebellious rescuers include George Harkness/Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Chato Santana/El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Waylon Jones/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje),  Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana, Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).\r\n\r\nOverall, **Suicide Squad** is surprisingly depressing and goes through the proverbial motions without so much as taking advantage of its surrealistic makeup. The movie never realizes its excitable potential and drifts into yet another superhero yarn that is more patchy than pronounced. Smith's Deadshot is out in the forefront but for the most part feels restrained and not as spry and savvy as one would imagine. Leto's Joker obviously pales in comparison to the brilliant and mesmerizing psychotic take on the role that earned the late Heath Ledger his posthumous Oscar statuette. In all fairness, nobody could inhabit the Clown Prince of Crime as Ledger uncannily did with committed concentration. Still, Leto's Joker--although viciously off-balance--felt recycled and furiously empty at times. Robbie's turn as Joker's misguided main squeeze merely comes off as a bratty Barbie Doll with synthetic edginess. The other **Squad** participants settle for the back burner more or less which is a crying shame because they should have been more engaged than the tepid material allowed them to be initially.\r\n\r\nWoefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper **Suicide Squad** is a detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand that needs to step up the pace if they expect to make a consistent and challenging impression on the devoted fanboys at the box office looking to move beyond the sardonic fantasy-based realm of another redundant serving of a _Batman/Superman_ entry.\r\n\r\n**Suicide Squad** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 3 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Will Smith, Jared Leto,  Margo Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez, Jai Courtney, Scott Eastwood, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Common, Cara Delevinge, Karen Fukuhara, Adam Beach\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: David Ayer\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga/Action & Adventure/Comic Book Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016)"

            "review": "The woefully generic **When the Bough Breaks** has the gloss factor going for it to a certain extent. Truthfully, its presentable package of panicky polish includes a stylish suspense piece highlighting an attractive cast involved in familiar dramatic cable-TV inspired shrugs and false jolts. Of course the creepy cradle falls in the mediocre **When the Bough Breaks** when the Jon Cassar-directed, Jack Olsen-written hollow horror showcase commits the real scare of resembling a lightweight Lifetime Movie Channel twitchy televised project. The so-called sinister shenanigans in **When the Bough Breaks** never feel majestic or mischievous enough to fill the realm of the big screen. Basically, Cassar\u2019s transparent tension-filled teaser is atmospheric and arbitrary in the surrogate pregnancy genre. The artificial thrills fail to wring any imaginative or inventive suspense that register with genuine anxiety.\r\n\r\nUltimately, **When the Bough Breaks** yearns to be a provocative pot-boiler with a high-end naughty pulse to its flat-lining frenzy of passion and pain. The real shame is that **Bough** commonly echoes the commonplace conventions of a potent cheesy sexual thriller we have seen countless times to no end. In fact, **When the Bough Breaks** could masquerade as a BET cable channel-based knockoff to filmmaker Adrian Lyne\u2019s 1987 psycho-sexual thrill vehicle _Fatal Attraction_ with an ethnic twist. In fact, **Bough** is in more of the synthetic spirit of the forgettable Beyonce Knowles-Idris Elba-Ari Larter 2009 horror slice-and-dice romancer _Obsession_. The regurgitated theme of a twisted younger spicy vixen looking to get her sensual hooks on the hunky object of desire at the expense of the harried wife on the cynical sidelines has played out in other preferable big screen and cable TV-bound flicks. Here in **Bough** the tired formula comes off as another strained, eye-rolling rip-off pertaining to the otherwise revisited jeopardized love triangle scenario.\r\n\r\nThus, **When the Bough Breaks** loses its credible balance when the movie morphs into another hysterical female psychopath waving a sharp utensil around in the name of cartoonish, toxic outrage. Joining the contemporary delusional divas such as the aforementioned _Fatal Attraction\u2019s_ Alex Forrest and _Obsession\u2019s_ Lisa Sheridan (how about going way back and looking at the doomed love triangle with seasoned actress Jessica Walter\u2019s crazed stalker Evelyn from 1971\u2019s Clint Eastwood-directed \u201cPlay Misty For Me\u201d) is Jaz Sinclair\u2019s (\u201cPaper Towns\u201d) sexy surrogate Anna looking to rock the titillating world of a handsome married man named John Taylor (Morris Chestnut).\r\n\r\nThe premise involves power professional couple John, an attorney, and his gorgeous established chef wife Laura (Regina Hall). They are both blessed with looks, materialistic excess and thriving careers but there is one main thing that alludes them as being completely sound in their lives\u2013the playful addition of a baby to start their growing family. The marital tension has been building between the Taylors and a child seems to be the immediate solution to healing. Unfortunately, Laura has had three miscarriages in the past. The Taylors have experimented with surrogates to carry their baby but to no avail. Time is running out as John and Laura grow restless and want results especially in the wake of a dire marriage needing stimulation.\r\n\r\nSoon, the Taylors will find some glimmer of hope in becoming parents when they get acquainted with the aforementioned 21-year old sexy waitress Jaz Walsh (Sinclair) and her sleazy abusive boyfriend Mike (Theo Rossi from TV\u2019s \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d). Anna, now impregnated, is at the mercy of Mike\u2019s beatings and decides to call John for help. John brings Anna back to his place to shelter away from the riff raffish Mike. The opportunity for taking in a pregnant and desperate Anna could prove beneficial for the childless married tandem. What the Taylors do not realize is how shifty and deceptive their new housemate is at heart.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks** follows the run-of-the-mill road map of lame suspense, tepid titillating sequences and by-the-book shocks that have about as much high-wire punch as poking a stale marshmallow. The tawdry scenes between youngish vamp Anna trying to seduce the wealthy yet unsatisfied older John feels mechanically orchestrated. The sex appeal among the main principals is an automatic given so there is bound to be some hormonal happenings in the bedroom or behind closed walls among the periled pretty people. In fact, Anna actually spies on the Taylors\u2019 private love-making session at one point but the payoff in watching this conniving cutie getting \u201cturned on\u201d by the private intimacy feels oddly uneventful and detached. Anna lusting after married stud-muffin John does not generate anything particularly provocative unless you find this curvaceous crackpot printing \u201cbaby\u201d on her puffed out tummy as the selling point of a twisted temptress gone to her loony limits.\r\n\r\nHad the filmmakers done a better job at exploring the damaged diva persona of Sinclair\u2019s Anna Walsh then maybe her tarnished tart routine would be more interesting and intriguing. Sinclair\u2019s Anna is reduced to \u201cbitchy and berzerk\u201d without much consideration in tapping further into her obvious \u201clost little girl\u201d syndrome. The trouble is that we have seen the Anna Walsh-type seductress in cinema numerous times before so the frenzied female in a tame and tedious **When the Bough Breaks** comes off as merely inconsequential. Sinclair certainly has perverse fun playing a \u201cpregnant plaything\u201d for Chestnut\u2019s stoic legal eagle that eventually bites into the alluring poisoned apple of Anna\u2019s tainted charm. It is too bad that the movie\u2019s unevenness and telegraphed toxicity recalls a scattershot flatness that never realizes its inspired potential. Even when John\u2019s unscrupulous plot is revealed the shakeup does not change Bough\u2019s disjointed direction.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks\u2019** so-called chilly effectiveness is dramatically stiffened despite the glitzy shine of its photogenic cast and pseudo-steamy situations. Furthermore, the inability to seize the moments of the unintentional campiness is somewhat glaring as well. The-bad-girl-with-the-baby-bump thriller feels like a typical wet diaper\u2013relentlessly saggy while carrying an unexpected load it cannot handle.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks** (2016)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 33 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Morris Chestnut, Regina Hall, Jaz Sinclair, Romany Malco, Theo Rossi, Tom Nowicki\r\n\r\nDirected by: Jon Cassar\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Drama/Suspense & Mystery\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016"

            "review": "> We actually know this story, but not the truth until now!\r\n\r\nRon Howard's latest sea adventure, stars Chris Hemsworth in an important role. So the people comparing it with 'Moby Dick', because both the film is about the same story, but one was inspired and the other one was, I mean this film was based on the actual event. I had seen the BBC film 'The Whale', not a bad film for a low budget television film. Most importantly, it revealed the truth about what I was not aware of from one of my favourite sea adventure films.\r\n\r\nI never read the book, but saw the British version, so I knew what I'm going to witness. Still, I was very interested to check it out, because it is a grand film and as expected I loved the visuals. Those sea adventures were very realistic, except the action sequences which is obviously cinema gimmick. The surprise part was the narration. It was a flashback story, something like 'Life of Pi', a man recall his old memory of his survival at the sea with other crew members of the ship Essex when it was attacked by a big white whale.\r\n\r\nIt is kind of impossible to believe what this film says is true. And obviously what we see is not what exactly happened, but very close. So see this film to believe it. Whatever it is, I totally enjoyed watching it. The 2 hour long never looked too long. There are a few mild disturbing scenes due to the theme concept, but it is a good family film. If you like 'Moby Dick' then you should watch it. Definitely an underrated film by the film critics.\r\n\r\n7/10"

They serve as constant reminders that no matter the seriousness, toil and drama poured into cinema, there\u2019s always room for levity.\r\n\r\nThat said, Argentinian writer-director Diego Rougier\u2019s \u201cSal\u201d hit me just the right way with its mix of Western iconography, gorgeous photography and limitless sardonicism.\r\n\r\nTo simply make the comparison between this darkly comic Western thriller and \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d seems insufficient, even though the Best Picture winner immediately springs to mind while watching \u201cSal.\u201d The influence of the Coen Bros. is steeped throughout this film, right from the opening caveat (a la \u201cFargo\u201d) that the story is based on true events \u2014 a claim that seems dubious but in good fun.\r\n\r\nFele Mart\u00ednez (best known from Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s \u201cAbre Los Ojos\u201d and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cBad Education\u201d) leads viewers between the world of aspiring screenwriter Sergio and the rough-and-tumble arena of revenge faced by Diego, a man for whom Sergio is mistaken after traveling to northern Chile to research his troubled script, a Western titled \u201cSal.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fabled Diego left some scores unsettled with the local jefe, Victor (Patricio Contreras), and his wife, Maria (Javiera Contadar, who also serves as producer), all of them Sergio must answer for, a mistaken identity case that reminds me of the fun and twisted \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d at times.\r\n\r\nAiding Sergio in his quest to find a tantilizing story for his script (not to mention survive the torment of Victor and his gang) is the old man Vizcacha (Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez), who himself has revenge on his mind vis a vis Victor.\r\nWhile somewhat heavy-handed in its transitions between the supposed reality of Sergio\u2019s script trip and the boots-and-belts drama of Diego, \u201cSal\u201d never suffers for lack of humor, especially from Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s mentor-hermit character and the comically irascible henchman Pascual (Luis Dubbo).\r\n\r\nEqually compelling is the rich cinematography of David Bravo, whose camera movements and respect for natural light across scorched desert days and fire-lit nights help ground the main narrative while indulging in color and saturation tricks for dream sequences and cutaways to the plot of Sergio\u2019s film-within-a-film.\r\n\r\nWhile some viewers may find the transitions grating and tiresome, the humor, performances and overall production quality in \u201cSal\u201d keep you invested and entertained."

Michael Caine and Luis Guzm\u00e1n both act really well with their character kids as well as Dwayne.\r\n\r\nThe biggest actual problem I have with this is the insistence in 3d technology.  It is really blatant and really weird sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe iconic action scenes in this are amazing, and were probably not cost efficient at all:  a giant lizard, bird or fish animated like this looks so good, but lasts for 5 minutes (?) and costs ridiculous amounts of money to get quality as good as this movie does.\r\n\r\nBut it's the \"no expense spared\" attitude that really makes this a good movie watching experience.  Yes, the writing is solid, and I love the idea of visiting the Mysterious Island, but the quality is what puts it over the top.\r\n\r\nWell worth the watch, but its the experience more than anything I can verbally express right now."

            "review": "Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 154 minutes long, so Wiki tells me (although whilst watching it it felt as though it flew by in a mere, ooh, fourteen hours or so?). 154 minutes. And I was lost, bored and checking my watch before the fourth minute. So I shall attempt to review a movie I have only just seen but about which I know almost nothing, and about which I care considerably less than that. The following will be far less a coherent review than a disjointed mess. Well, fine. Seems perfectly apt.\r\n\r\nSo, years ago, the old Autobot leader Sentinel Prime crashed into the moon along with some teleporter doowacky - made up of hundreds of \"pillars\" - that only he can control. The Decepticons swiped almost all the pillars but left Sentinel there. On a routine military... um... I'm not sure; Jolly Boy's Outing? Optimus Prime gets into a fracas with Decepticon Shockwave and finds a couple of these pillars. He then throws a strop 'cos the humans knew about this bit of Cybertron kit but never told him, but now they're more than happy to, I suppose. Um. So Optimus rocks up to the moon and finds Sentinel Prime and revives him. Turns out this is what the Decepticons wanted; only Optimus could revive him and only Sentinel can work the teleporter doowacky (the \"Bridge\"). So now they're after Sentinel. But OH NOES, Sentinel has decided that the Autobots are fighting a lost cause, so he's throwing in with the Decepticons anyway. Cue lots of deeply confusing and tedious \"Tranny-Slapping\" as I have just dubbed the Transformer skirmishes as Megatron, Sentinel and the baddies try to use the Bridge to... um, pull their faraway home of Cybertron to Earth? Or turn Earth into Cybertron? Or something.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sam Witwicky* (Shia LaBeouf, even more punchable than usual, which by his standards is quite something) is not just a useless nerd this time around, he's also a whingeing **** who wants a) international acclaim and credit (other than the medal awarded him by the president of course!) for his part in saving the world twice even though nobody knows that that's what he's done, and b) a 40-hour job. Anything really; Trolley-dolly at Asda/Walmart will be fine. Despite all this he seems to have effortlessly brushed off Megan Fox and continued to punch way, way above his weight with his new squeeze, Rosie DoubleBarrelled-Surname: English, impossibly attractive, permanently dressed for all occasions - work, play, sleep, dragging her ****hole across the carpet like a worm-ridden doggie - like a $200-an-hour prostitute, and, incredibly, at least 40% stupider even than Ms. Fox, who as we know is marginally less alert and responsive than a squeezed tube of Anusol. How does Sam fit in to the so-called \"plot\"? Who knows. Double-Barrelled's smarmy, supercar-distributing walking hard-on of a boss turns out to be a Decepticon bitch (Deceptibitch?), and... oh, Christ knows. Alls I DO know is that this time around, Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have joined John Turturro in shilling for dollars like a ****-flashing strumpet. \"Me so shaaaameless.\" \"Me overact LONG time!\" \"Me so shaaaameless.\" Sucky-f*cky, five million dollar?\r\n\r\nFrom the very first second to the very last, the whole thing is needlessly convoluted, comically unfeasible - even within its own logic, such as that is - and most crucially, lifeforce-sappingly dull. Just like the other two movies, and of course just like the Transformers themselves. At one point, maybe two-thirds in (or maybe seven weeks in, who knows?), the angsty, poignant strains of a generic rock ballad signalled the arrival of a \"sad\" scene. On-screen, people crouched and clasped their heads in anguish, weeping and hugging in amongst considerable swathes of burning scenery and unspecifiable wreckage. I'm not sure why this bit was to be considered sad or poignant; perhaps the entire cast simultaneously realised they were in a Transformers movie.\r\n\r\nAwful, awful. As bad as anything Bay has ever shat out during his spiteful, cynical, moviegoer-hating and barely-disguised subterfuge as a \"film director\"."

It is an anthology film, that contains two parallel moving stories, which are connected by a freak accident in Chennai. A young architect, falls in love with a young beautiful pediatric doctor, runs after her and tries to convince her to marry her, while, simultaneously, a morose ex-football coach troubles a software engineer by vowing to kill his eight-year-old son. How these characters get connected and confronted through the accident forms the crux of the story.",

            "review": "Over their storied career, the Coen Brothers have made some of the most original, most iconoclastic, and most critically-acclaimed films of all time. They've tackled adaptations (No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and remakes (The Ladykillers) before, of course, but even these films have borne the brothers' unmistakable mark of originality, their skewed vision of the world, and their cynical, sarcastic sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, to make of True Grit?\r\n\r\nIt's termed a re-adaptation of the original Charles Portis novel, a \"re-imagining,\" in the parlance of our time. One is hardly able to discuss the film without the spectre of John Wayne, however: the best-known adaptation of the book was one of the film legend's definitive roles, one of those cultural touchstones that rarely if ever are engineered. Discussion of that film invariably centers on Wayne and his performance: a washed-up, forgotten cowpoke that seemed tailor-made for Wayne to draw on his position at the time. A direct predecessor of Mickey Rourke and The Wrestler.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that it was the Coens' pedigree that moved me to see this film. I've by nature little interest in Westerns, but despite producing a few lesser films (I'm looking at you, Burn After Reading), the Coens' sheer talent, along with the casting of Jeff Bridges in the John Wayne role, had me intrigued.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple and straightforward: The father of young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is murdered by a two-bit criminal (Josh Brolin), and she takes it upon herself to see him brought to justice. To that end, she hires a reputedly ferocious US Marshal named Rueben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), while a prideful Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) tags along, hoping to bring the perpetrator to justice for a big reward.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it, really. Completely absent is the trademark Coen plotting, convoluted subplots that twist and turn over onto themselves as though the script were one enormous M\u00f6bius strip (M\u00f6bius script?). Gone are the defiance of genre definitions, the satirical take on stories, the feeling of the brothers Coen peering through the camera lens at their subjects as though they're studying specimens in a jar. This is straightforward filmmaking, telling a simple tale with all the incredible talent and creative power the Coens command.\r\n\r\nSo what's not missing, then, are the richness of character, impeccable performances, beautiful cinematography and arresting score that are the other hallmarks of a Coen film. Attention is naturally centered on Jeff Bridges, having the audacity to take on one of the defining performances of one of the most famous actors ever. Bridges doesn't attempt to mimic Wayne. He crawls into this character and wears him like a suit. A hairy, shaggy, smelly suit. But Bridges inverts the typical presentation of such a character: instead of offering the audience with a cold, unfeeling badass whose heart is gradually thawed by the presence of a precocious youngster, this Cogburn is introduced as a shiftless layabout with a reputation who seems to have all but given up on such activities in favor of sleeping and boozing, the events of the film conspiring to scrape away that useless crust to reveal the force of nature beneath. Matt Damon, an actor who's never been in a Coens film before but seems as though he should have, also offers a great performance as the proud and buffoonish Texas Ranger LeBeouf, as do Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin in their short but effective appearances as heavies.\r\n\r\nBut the yeoman's work lies not on Bridges' grimy, slouched shoulders. Instead, our focus is on fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross, and the performance given by fourteen-year-old Hailee Steinfeld is, in short, one-of-if-not-the finest performance I've seen in quite a long time. Not content with giving such an incredible performance as a young teenager, this is, to boot, Steinfeld's first film performance. Steinfeld's Mattie Ross is smart, wily, mature, childish, scared, brave, and a force of nature in her own right. She has been wronged, she will see that wrong redressed, and nothing will stand in her way. An early scene in which she negotiates with a trader for horses and money is not only hilarious but revealing, one of the best character introductions in film history.\r\n\r\nSuch an unexpectedly straightforward film from the Coens deserves an equally straightforward judgment: I truly loved this film. There is so much greatness contained within it, from the powerhouse performances of Bridges and Steinfeld to the dark, touching, hilarious script, to Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography, to Carter Burwell's haunting score comprised of reorchestrations of classic hymns. It's one of the most perfect films I've ever seen. This is the second fantastic remake I've seen this year, the second to eclipse the original (the first being the superlative Let Me In). If you're wondering whether or not to see this film, wait no longer: go immediately to your nearest theater and buy a ticket. Speaking for myself: I can't wait to see it again."

I felt like his character is how he is in real life a little. Pierce Brosnan. Handsome as always. Although I really didn't like his character at first, I have to say, paid off in the end. Robert's sister in the movie was great. You just gotta love her character. How can you not? \r\n\r\nThis is not a heavy drama movie. It's just right. Of course I didn't really like the love interest of Robert in this movie. I mean she kissed him, made love to him (even if it's fake but still!!!), she's a lucky girl and I don't like it. I don't like the ending. It's not really what we call a very happy ending. But even if it's a not-so-happy ending, it still turned out to be a good ending with the things that happened to the characters in the end.\r\n\r\nMy grade for this movie, B. I recommend it to all Robert Pattinson fans (which I think you've all seen this movie already), people who like love stories, family stories, not-so-heavy-drama movie."

Not only is it not a very good one, it just offers the same story. **Again**. This is three Men in Black movies in a row where the A-plot is totally encapsulated by one sentence: \"Stop the creepy-crawly in a human suit from getting the jewelery.\" There's a supporting role alien that was pretty endearing though.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

Now, I'm not a prolific watcher of the rom-com genre and honestly I've probably only seen a few of them throughout my entire life to this point. I bring this up because it seems like most of the criticisms people have of this film deal with the idea that it's not all that original and the only thing it did differently was add in foul language. I, on the other hand, really enjoyed this film for what it is. I think this is primarily because I'm still pretty inexperienced with the rom-com genre, but I also think it's because there's nothing really \"wrong\" with this film. Does it lean more on romance than comedy? Sure, but I actually appreciated that choice. Is the story about as surface level as it gets? Yes, but I also think that the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher largely makes up for that flaw. I knew, along with everyone else who has seen this film, how it was going to end the entire time, but I was still interested in how it would get to that point, and I can't say that I was dissatisfied when the credits rolled. \r\n\r\nIn the end, No Strings Attached is a perfectly fine romantic comedy. It's not going to blow your socks off, but you'll get your fix off of it."

I did _NOT_ see that at all in this movie. In fact, one criticism that I have is that I'd liked to have seen a little more comedy.  One of the characters is truly over the top, but not slapstick.  But regardless this movie flows elegantly start to finish without being overly saccharine or morbid or falling back on what you might expect for comedy involving the elderly.  This film won't move you like Slumdog Millionaire but it is a quality film in its own right."

Still I watched this, largely due to the involvement of several favorite actors and the script having been written by the Duplass brothers.\r\n\r\nI found it almost instantly both funny and moving, and the longer I watched, the more confused I became as to why most critics had been lukewarm or downright dismissive of it. I figured it had to be mostly due to the genre blend of comedy and more dramatic issues, and that probably most of the criticism had been along the usual lines of \"can't make up it's mind', etc. But even so, that didn't add up to a meager 40% rating, with such a clever script and great acting.\r\n\r\nWhen the credits rolled, I knew instantly why: A happy ending...\r\n\r\nIt all mostly works out in the end for the oddball protagonists. Critics in general can't stand it. If a movie has had a degree of realism and/or several dark or borderline dark-ish issues brought up along the way, critics tend to go ******* unless it all ends in misery, or largely unresolved, or at the very least in ambiguity. God forbid you walk away from such a movie actually feeling good; that equals 'cheesy' in most reviewers book. Was it realistic that most of the people involved got a happy, somewhat romantic ending? Of course not, but though the movie tackles several 'real' issues within the comedy, I found the ending perfectly fitting with the tone of it. Critics often use the word 'predictable' about anything that has a hint of romantic comedy in it, but I'd say, there are few things as predictable as movie critics in general.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read what I consider a spot on review for this, check out Empire Magazine, who went against the stream and gave it 4 out of 5 stars."

However, I found myself watching a very straightforward drama-thriller about corporate espionage and morality that reminded me of the corporate thrillers from the 80s and 90s. The acting is good and the movie looks good.\r\n\r\nSo, is the movie dated and boring then? You could see it that way. The standards for a movie in this genre have obviously become quite high. Audiences are waiting for several interconnecting layers in the story and want plot twists after plot twists. And with a cast as formidable as this, the movie must come from the biggest money and therefore the most exhilaratingly modern script, right? Well, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIt seems that 'Paranoia' is a just another mediocre movie that you really don't need to see. It's sometimes implausible but sometimes it's decent drama. Just because the audience was disappointed in their own expectations, doesn't mean it deserves all this bashing. 32 on Metacritic and 4.9 on IMDb (2013-11-10)? That's pretty damn low.\r\n\r\nI read that Stephen Holden of The New York Times said about the lead actor, Liam Hemsworth: \"Not since Taylor Lautner has Hollywood ogled a pretty boy this vacant and poorly prepared.\" Again I'm reminded of the 80s and one Tom Cruise. Was his substance and skill any better?"

The always charming Melissa George helps carry this movie but everyone plays their parts well. I give the movie a 6/10."
