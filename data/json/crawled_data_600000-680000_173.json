Now it's got 4 Oscar nods, even though it is very sad the movie is a hit and miss. A slipped away opportunity, had a great storyline, but the outcome was decent. An important historical biopic, at least for a certain section of the audience. I respect that, but it did not impress me as I anticipated.\r\n\r\nFrom the Academy Award winning director for the movie 'The King's Speech', and the last year's winner for a lead role, Eddie Reddmayne together did not deliver the expected masterpiece. But Alicia Vikander was so good, another brilliant co-female-star display just like Felicity Jones from Eddie's previous movie 'The Theory of Everything'. If I were a jury I would definitely give the supporting actress award to her, that's the result I'm hoping for in the next Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe actor did a hard work for the title role, in the many scenes he mastered it, but that's where I slightly disappointed. I felt his character was a little intense, maybe I'm not getting him because I'm straight. The locations, costumes, even the direction and music were good. Both the lead actors kind looks alike, no doubt on the casting, but it only should have been a bit better in exhibiting story.\r\n\r\nMaybe the pace should have been a little quicker as well as some sentimentally appealing scenes would have done good. I desperate to give more marks, but I can't go beyond this. I won't consider it a bad flick, what I meant was a missed opportunity to be a masterpiece. So overall,  it is a good watch.\r\n\r\n7/10"

It's _almost_ as if they wanted to go the **complete opposite** of the original series' sparsely-detailed animation by packing every single frame as full of colour & movement & distraction & pointlessness as they possibly could.\r\n\r\nNo, not _almost_... it's what they actually did!

Starring Nic Cage, film follows Cage's hit-man to Bangkok where he is to complete a number of hits. He tells us via narration that he has a set of rules that he follows so as to survive in the \"business\". He then promptly breaks his own codes and his life comes under threat.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it as regards plotting. The Pang's bring much visual style to the picture, and show themselves to be adept at action sequences, but it all feels so familiar. Action movies are rarely going to bring new stuff to the table, they often, as is the case here, are kinetic popcorn pictures missing some emotional depth to marry up with the carnage. Thus this is not a film to be sought out by any action junkies looking for something new to add to their collections. As it happens Cage is fine and broody, managing to blend hard ass machismo with vulnerable traits. He, and the filmic style make it above average, even if ultimately it's instantly forgettable afterwards. 6/10"

Sela Ward plays the psycho\u2019s new fianc\u00e9 while Amber Heard is on hand as the stepson\u2019s girlfriend.\r\n\r\n\"The Stepfather\" (2009) is a solid crime drama/thriller with a bit o' slasher horror, a combination of the original film (1987) and its sequel (1989). All of the Stepfather flicks are loosely based on mass murderer John List. They contain elements of movies like \"Psycho\" (1960/1998) mixed with coming-of-age drama, like \u201cFright Night\u201d (1985) and \u201cDisturbia\u201d (2007). \r\n\r\nWalsh effectively portrays the delusional titular character while Badgley is competent as the teen protagonist. Meanwhile the director takes every opportunity to show Heard in a bikini or underwear, but she\u2019s way too thin to stir much interest despite her obvious attractiveness. She\u2019s more appealing after she acquired some curves, e.g. as Mera in \u201cAquaman\u201d (2018).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day this is an updated, slightly more compelling version of the first film and its sequel. There are just enough changes to make it worthwhile if you\u2019re familiar with the prior flicks. On the downside, it\u2019s a little predictable, but what else is new? \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles & Santa Clarita, California (with studio work done in Culver City).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"

            "review": "Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa."

Borderline Steven Segal territory ocassionally, or at the very least Jean Claude Van Damme... But without the fighting skills.\r\n\r\nSo yeah not an impressive film."

Fairly simple and straightforward plot where the good guys stays pretty much stays as the good guys throughout the move and the hero is really someone that kicks ass throughout the movie. No bloody fussing around with making the hero \u201chuman\u201d or some crap like that.\n\nThe special effects and the apocalyptic sceneries where well done. In general the film was a solid piece of work. The transfer to Blu-ray equally well done. Picture quality was as to be expected and the DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack well balanced with just enough surround effects and LFE to make it very enjoyable.\n\nThe film get a 5.7 rating at IMDB which in my mind is a bit on the low side but then, it\u2019s not really a film for everyone. The so called \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes gave it 17% which is just pure bullshit but then I have given up on those idiots a long time ago. Most of those \u201ccritics\u201d must come from the American bible belt or something \ud83d\ude26"

Ah, the 60s, when America appeared at once to be both starting to \"get it\" and also coming apart at the seams.\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald was introduced to the world as a lone sharp shooter who felled a president. But, very early in the aftermath, there were doubts and details that, in total, just didn't seem to add up. Accordingly, theories proliferated questioning the veracity of that official position in light of evidence and the interpretations thereof. If the official story is not what happened, is there a plausible scenario that would more reasonably account for all those details, moving us closer to the truth of what may otherwise have actually happened?\r\n\r\nAnd thus, we have Shooter. \r\n\r\nNo, it is no attempt to flesh out, to the last inch, everything that is or may have been about Oswald. It's a story that has parallels - and even a non-casual mention of/reference to the Kennedy assassination to help us watching at home realize what we were actually watching - a plausible scenario."

The Bucket List is one such film. Its message is simple, its filming style equally so. It's performed with such quality by Nicholson and Freeman (if the whole film had just been the two of them chatting in the hospital room it would have been a winner), with director Rob Reiner astute and wily enough to let them flow, that even as the inevitable sadness follows the laughs, you will feel far better for having watched this film.\r\n\r\nRewarding adult cinema with class showing on both sides of the camera. 8.5/10"

What does it leave us with? Well - this type of Bond film unfortunately. Staggeringly bland and uninteresting.  If we removed the name Bond from the film we would have no idea that we were watching a Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIt is depressing that they flushed 40 years of fun Bond films down the toilet to satiate people who dislike classic Bond adventures. They reached for a wider audience by going all generic action film to the detriment of the Bond legacy.\r\n\r\nWho is this unsophisticated, short, blond man in the suit? Unfortunately, _he could be anyone_ - even you or I. Bond is now a lager chugging everyman. Ian Fleming would be furious.\r\n\r\nNo chance of Craig's Bond wearing  _a strap on plastic seagull hat_ as Connery did in the classic Goldfinger (1964) - they would not dare make the films that fun and entertaining anymore.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame what they did to the Bond films."

Michael Sheen buffs up into Karl Urban, who as Lucian (bad ass Lycan) leads his species to a bloody revolt, and Kate Beckinsale has made way narratively for Rhona Mitra, who sexes things up. The action is pulse raising and the Gothic designs and atmospherics are first rate, while the battle royale finale is fit to crown any genre film of its type. \r\n\r\nProblems are evident, though. The constant flow of CGI blood becomes irritating after a while, and Bill Nighy (in spite of being a franchise regular) is still looking miscast! But it has proved to be a series with hairy legs and fangs that refuses to die, a popcorn munchers dream. So enjoy the spectacle and the screenplay homages, and I'll have a bag of tortilla chips and a choc ice please. 6.5/10"

That guy lied about... Just everything.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

Combine their powers and you\u2019re guaranteed a good time. So it is with _Step Brothers_ their 2008 collaboration. \r\n\r\n_Two aimless middle-aged losers still living at home are forced against their will to become roommates when their parents marry._\r\n\r\nTaking the slacker stereotype and turning it up to 11 there\u2019s a good time to be had with this film. The chemistry between Ferrell and Reilly is excellent and in the scenes where they are let loose with the ad libs the film hits top gear. There\u2019s some brilliant insults, a hilariously contrived situation, and in addition to the leads, the supporting cast are also all on point. \r\n\r\nThis one is a bit of a classic in the catalogues of Ferrell and Reilly, and is always worth a re-watch if you need a good laugh."

This movie is essentially a long series of SNL sketches sewn together.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of this style of writing because it doesn't seem to matter what order you put some of the bits in, it's just stopping the story to tell a joke or two, moving onto another joke or two, etc., until they decide to go back to the part of the movie that progresses the story.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, watching a movie like this critically is counter intuitive, but even if I were to turn my brain off and enjoy it, I'm not a fan of drug humor, Dewey Cox is a jerk, and the music focused comedy isn't that good to me, despite the music actually being enjoyable itself.  \"Let's Duet\" was really good though.\r\n\r\nThere something to like in here, and I can see it: it's just not enough to get me to come back when there are so many options out there."

            "review": "Lake Ends In The Road.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Last House on the Left is directed by Dennis Iliadis and adapted to screenplay by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth from the story by Wes Craven (co-producer here). A remake of Craven\u2019s 1972 film of the same name (itself influenced by Ingmar Bergman\u2019s The Virgin Spring), it stars Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Spencer Treat Clark and Martha MacIsaac. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Sharone Meir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring a family vacation, teenagers Mari (Paxton) and Paige (MacIsaac) are viciously set about by a gang led by recent prison escapee Krug (Dillahunt). When bad weather forces Krug\u2019s car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari\u2019s parents. When the parents realise what their new lodgers have done, they begin to enact bloody retribution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s pointless going on about remakes of old horror films, they are here to stay and we continue to watch them in the hope that they will strike a chord with us. With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade\u2019s horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its \u201cterrifying\u201d reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn\u2019t have enough class in them to give Bergman\u2019s movie a run for its money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job. The pertinent question exists, are you capable of such violence having had violence inflicted on your loved ones previously? What would you do in the same situation that Mari\u2019s parents find themselves in?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have been privy to what was meted out to poor Mari and Paige, and the impact is most distressing. There is good cause to argue that Iliadis and his production team go too far in grabbing our attention in readiness for the \u201crevenge\u201d factor later on. Certainly I myself was uncomfortable watching it, as I was with the I Spit on Your Grave remake, but it\u2019s about getting a prescribed response, however close to the knuckle it is.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a film anyone can feel comfortable about recommending, surely? But I know it put me through a gamut of emotions, even making me feel bad about myself the next day. That is quite often the power of cinema, and clearly the banner that Craven and Iliadis held aloft during the publicity tours for The Last House on the Left. Today I give the film an uneasy 7/10, it\u2019s uncompromising and unapologetically violent, but also laced with flaws. On another day I may find myself rating it considerably lower\u2026"

While his brother becomes drawn into left-wing politics, Accio, the hotheaded younger brother, is taken under the wing of a market trader and while under his influence, joins the Fascist party. Accio (\"Bully\") is a nickname he is proud of because it makes him seem tough. Manrico and their sister Violetta are alarmed to hear their brother listening to Benito Mussolini's speeches in his room. Manrico often physically torments his brother, including stuffing his head in the barrel under the drain pipe of their house.",

Especially especially especially in comedy sequels to cult classics where they waited twenty years since the last entry. When you dig that far, and look at the company that _Super Troopers 2_ keeps, it's not exactly promising.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly enough though, I actually kind of dig this movie? It is in no way better than the first, it's not even in any way **as good** as the first, but I did feel that it was **worthy** of the first, I had more than a couple of pretty genuine out-loud laughs, and that's not something I get a lot from the cinema of today.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

As the story plods along, stopping only briefly for some guttural violence now and then, it becomes evident that the makers have made a painfully boring movie. At first the drained out colour photography looks like a masterstroke of ethereal atmospherics, but this also wears off and only compounds the overall feeling of monotony that pervades the pic.\r\n\r\nHugely disappointing venture from a director capable of so much more. 3/10"

            "review": "The first thing that went through my head the second Sunshine Cleaning ended, was 'I could have gone on watching for at least another hour'. Not just because it ended a little abruptly, but mostly because I so thoroughly enjoyed this film, that I was seriously disappointed when it was over. It's like that book that's so compelling that you just want to inhale every word, but dread to actually finish.\r\n\r\nSunshine Cleaning is about two sisters, who, driven by dire financial straits, decide to start \"a biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up service\", cleaning up the houses of people who died gruesome deaths. The premise is fairly simple, but executed in a very lovely, heart-warming way, half tragedy \u2013 half comedy. Because of course, this film is not only about cleaning up other people's mess, but also about cleaning up some of their own baggage along the way, especially when the sisters are confronted with the memory of a death akin to what is now their daily business. Somewhere in between all this they have to deal with their eccentric father, the elder sister's peculiar son, love, loss, failure and a glimmer of hope. Reading this back now I realise this actually sounds really cheesy and sentimental, but I would have hated it if it was. Trust me.\r\n\r\nAmy Adams plays Rose, the eldest of the two, and Emily Blunt plays Norah, the rebellious younger sister. Rarely have I seen such great chemistry and energy between a leading pair. These two women make it seem like they've been working together for years, and physically they're a perfect match too, they actually look they could be sisters. Rose is obviously the mature, sensible one, whereas Norah just kind of takes things as they come, not worrying and not taking responsibility for her life. Though they seem to be bound not so much by kinship, but rather by a mutual fate and childhood hardship that has left its mark on both of them, although they deal with it very differently. Rose tries desperately to build a better life for herself and her son, but rarely finds any luck on her path. Norah just wings it and refuses to grow up.\r\n\r\nBoth Amy Adams and Emily Blunt prove to have great star quality and talent, and I think I can now officially call myself a fan of both. They are raw and real, one is sweet and the other is sour, without overacting anything. Alan Arkin is great as their dad. Eccentric, bitter yet loving, idealistic and seemingly in a mild state of denial. He plays pretty much the same character as in that other (great!) film of Sunshine Cleaning's producers, Little Miss Sunshine, where he also played the grumpy granddad. This type of role seems to be custom-made for him. Another great part is played by professional chameleon Clifton Collins, Jr. He plays Winston, the owner of a cleaning supplies shop, and he turns out to be that small shimmer of good luck that Rose so desperately needs. Actually, everyone in this film is so perfectly cast that it almost seems like this is a real family, in a real situation. It just doesn't feel contrived in any way, despite the lack of originality and obvious pitfalls where the story could have easily crashed and burned into a wasteland of melodrama and false sentiment. But like I mentioned earlier, this doesn't happen at any point. Usually when a film is on the borderline of becoming a total clich\u00e9, and yet works out successfully, it is because of one or maybe two factors. However, with Sunshine Cleaning, it's all of them. Cast, screenplay, dialogue, direction, camera work, production, just everything is wonderful. I'm actually running out of superlatives to describe this film.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to give this film 10 stars, however there is just one small thing that kind of failed in my opinion and that's the ending. Nothing wrong with it story-wise, it just ended so abruptly that it feels like they literally ran out of tape. It actually kind of threw me off. But... oh, what the heck, this film deserves 10 stars, easily.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sunshine Cleaning is just a beautifully crafted story about falling (hard) and getting back up on your feet again. It has a real indie-feel to it, it's basically just a pretty little art house gem. Funny thing \u2013 while I'm writing this, 4 Non Blondes' \"What's Up\" is playing in the background, and it feels strangely appropriate to the feeling of this film. So if you want to know what to expect of Sunshine Cleaning, listen to that song, it really captures the essence of the story. \r\n\r\nI can't think of much more to say to sell this film, all I can do is strongly recommend Sunshine Cleaning to pretty much anyone and everyone. It's wonderful.\r\n_(May 2012)_"

Starring Melissa Leo, Michael Parks, John Goodman, Michael Angarano, Kerry Bishe and Nicholas Braun, story finds Parks heading up a Christian cult that lures horny youngsters to their place of worship on the promise of sex with an older woman. Of course once the lads get there it\u2019s not long before the truth of the lure is revealed and we are treated to hate spiel by sermon and some unpleasantness from the production code edition of the torture porn play book. \r\n\r\nRed State is an infuriating movie in many ways, but it is never dull and it always remains challenging, even if some of Smith\u2019s sermonising agendas lack cohesion entering the final third of the piece. In fact there are three tonal shifts that don\u2019t make an altogether appetising whole, Smith straining to bridge the gap between satire and horror \u2013 cum \u2013 thriller. And sadly the climax to all the damaged threads is very anti-climatic. On the major plus side is a cast doing fine work, headed by Goodman, Leo and Parks, the latter getting to play lead dog for a change. It\u2019s impressively shot by Dave Klein and Smith shows flickers of there being a good director in the mix. \r\n\r\nPoor box office and bad reviews upon release inevitably got it tarnished as a bad film. In truth it\u2019s a fascinating failure, but it has merits enough to warrant time spent with it. From Westboro to Waco, stopping briefly for a night in a Hostel, Red State is not easily forgotten once sampled. For better or worse. 6/10"

            "review": "***A famous director loses his inspiration and seeks aid from the various women in his life*** \r\n\r\nReleased in 2009, \u201cNine\u201d is a drama/musical about a famous Italian director in 1965 (Daniel Day-Lewis) who loses his inspiration, but its urgent he gets it back because his ninth movie is set to start shooting in ten days and he doesn\u2019t even have a script. He turns to the several women in his life for succor: his wife (Marion Cotillard), his mistress (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), his costume designer (Judi Dench), his star actress (Nicole Kidman), his mother (Sophia Loren), a fashion journalist (Kate Hudson) and a prostitute from his boyhood (Fergie).\r\n\r\nThis is an adaptation of the 1982 Broadway musical, also dubbed \u201cNine,\u201d which itself was based on Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical 1963 film \u201c8\u00bd.\u201d It\u2019s very similar to director Rob Marshall\u2019s \u201cChicago\u201d (2002), but with a different story, cast and location (Rome and points nearby).\r\n\r\nDuring the first half I wasn\u2019t so sure about the story, but I eventually found myself absorbed into the life of the tormented director and his mid-life crisis. His unfaithfulness to his beautiful wife, Luisa (Cotillard), is off-putting of course, but maybe we should have mercy for a man who has scores of gorgeous women offering themselves to him practically every day. It helps that he WANTS to be free from his adulteries and be true to Luisa.\r\n\r\nYet I have a hard time picturing Guido (Day-Lewis) seeking the amorous attentions of Carla (Cruz) above Luisa. Carla is decent, as far as all-around physical beauty goes, but Luisa has better curves. Both of the characters\u2019 have imaginative dance sequences, but Luisa comes out on top even though her routine is less tantalizing.\r\n\r\nDay-Lewis is fascinating as the guilt-stricken director who hasn\u2019t let his fame go to his head. When he asks a cleric for advice about God and his troubles, the vicar responds: \u201cImagination is God\u2019s garden, don\u2019t let the devil play in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI generally don\u2019t favor musicals where the characters suddenly jump into song & dance while walking at the park or eating dinner. My wife & I sometimes poke fun of these kinds of musicals by mimicking them while doing mundane activities. For me, musicals only work, generally speaking, when the singing/dancing sequences are legitimate, like a performance at a nightclub or one's imagination, both of which were used in \"Chicago.\" Of course it\u2019s more challenging and takes more creativity to incorporate song & dance routines in this manner and keep the movie seamless & realistic. \u201cNine\u201d does this.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes and was shot in Italy and England.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

            "review": "Nothing new and only proving that the horror genre in 2008 wasin need of reinvigoration.  \r\n\r\nJennifer Marsh is a secret service agent, her speciality is crime across the internet. One day she comes across a site that is untraceable, the host of the site conducts painful killings to entertain the watching public. The kicker being that the more people who log on and observe, the quicker the death will be, and, well people being people...\r\n\r\nThere really isn't much to recommend here, outside of a solid performance from Diane Lane as Marsh, and some newer ingenious deaths to woo the gorno crowd, it's a buy the numbers horror thriller that seems to come along every three months. The villain is incredibly weak, the script is tepid and uninspiring, and the ending is as predictable as anything that has been done badly before. The premise promised so much as well, we are all here in an internet driven age, so what a perfect chance the makers had to play on users fears, sadly this fails in the same way that 2006s Stay Alive failed, thinking the premise alone will make a great genre piece.\r\n\r\nIf you liked Hostel 12 and Saw 37, chances are you will get something from this film, but the original Saw, Cube and My Little Eye seem a million miles away now, for at least they had originality and vitality in their favour, Untraceable just comes across as a big league cash cow milking the purses of gorno children who fail to see the blunt hammer hitting them over the head. 3/10 for Diane only."

Sanctum is what it is, a glossy exercise in 3D film making, a disaster movie awash with clich\u00e9s and contrivances, a picture that\u2019s narrative drive comes from following a well worn formula in this particular sphere of genre film making. Is it fun? Thrilling? Oh absolutely! The effects work is super at times, the scenery equally so, whilst some of the set pieces are dynamite. If you can get past the cheese and clich\u00e9 buffet bar then there\u2019s a whole bunch of tasty treats to be sampled down in those dark and dingy cave formations\u2026\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s directed by Alister Grierson but in truth this is a Cameron movie, and with that comes the fact that it\u2019s the best and worst of Cameron.

            "review": "Following a devastating storm, a small town in Maine finds that the eerie mist swarming into the neighborhood holds a deadly secret inside that attacks anyone around them and forces a small band of survivors trapped inside a supermarket to hold off the creatures.\r\n\r\nThis one here is an incredibly frustrating King work. A lot of what makes this one so uneven is due to there being a lot to really like about it, a few points to love about it and then there were elements to utterly loathe about it. The film is at it's best with the way the mounting hysteria over the situation with them trapped within the supermarket and how the groups resolve their problems and start new ones which was pretty good and makes for a realistic feeling to the story, detailing how it all breaks down and what the group resorts to in order to keep their sanity. Likewise, that in turn leads into the films' best efforts in the first few attacks with the unknown creatures inside the mist killing off the victims as they refuse to believe what's out there and rush foolishly into the area which makes for a series of fun times out in the cargo hold and the different attempts to reach safety outside and then encountering the different creatures and their powers were all good points. The flying insects and them trying to keep them out as the different creatures break in resulting in a series of great encounters trying to clear them out of the store, and the insane battle in the pharmacy during the pitch-black interior is a rather stark and creepy experience fighting off the array of creatures that gives this one a ton of impressive points. The final few battles and escapes to get out, the blood and gore and the way that the creatures are dealt with are all loved points here as that all leads into the stellar finale which is an absolutely unforeseen and shocking in what goes on as there are some rather disturbing parts in this section. Along with the fine creature effects, these here are the good parts to really love about it although it does have a few issues to be had here. The film's biggest problem is the mere appearance of the religious babble that gets spewed in here which is so wrongheaded and rather off-putting it just makes the viewer feel like not watching it all that often. Yet another big issue here is the length and how overlong it feels, with the rather overlong sections in the middle really making it feel it's length somewhat. While there's plenty to like here, these do hold it back.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and intense themes of children-in-danger."

He can handle the whole movie by himself and this film is a great example. It totally surprised me, I expected it to be an average film, but it was an awesome comedy. We have seen plenty of bride and groom and marriage related comedies, but this was a slightly different yet a fantastic treat.\r\n\r\nI don't think it was wonderful because of the jokes alone, but unique characters and actors who performed them were brought the fine outcome. I felt like I know what's coming, but the ending was simple and smart. Like always when I like a movie a lot I hope for a sequel to come and they should make one for this as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a Kevin Hart's time as a comedian, his top box office films are all from the recent time, so he must make use of it and I am expecting his upcoming projects. This is a perfect weekend movie to have some laughs. Middle finger to the film critics. I definitely recommended it not only for the film fanatics but all. Who knows you might find it much better than the recent 'Get Hard'.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd/10"

Rickards is chased through the streets of San Diego and onto a train, where he makes a clean get-away with the cash. Now Poppo wants both the video and his money back, but must contend with the FBI, con men, and his long-time nemesis \"The Greek\". Despite advice from San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders and Watergate legend G. Gordon Liddy, Rickards loses track of both the money and the video-tape. He is then tricked into a dramatic showdown with Kaiser Poppo and a 30-year-old secret is finally revealed. Written by Jay Reed Stevens",

If you didn't (which granted many didn't) then tread carefully I suppose.\r\n"

I thought it will be one of those movies wherein it turns out just okay because it's not a Disney/Pixar movie. I mean....if it's not a Disney/Pixar movie, don't expect anything. Which was good I think because not expecting turned out great for me. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very entertaining (aside from the noisy children and a very noisy and loud mom behind us). I know Toby will like this movie (he actually was able to watch it from beginning to end...for the first time). There's just so much to see. And the ending. Such a tragic ending but it's still a happy ending don't worry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A. Good for kids. Good for adults."

Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.\r\n\r\nThematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a \"It's a Wonderful Life\" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!\r\n\r\nThe action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10"

It tells the story of a young wife whose husband fighting Germans during the 1940s war. When her village was taken control by the Nazi army, an officer was assigned to stay in her house. He's not like the other German soldiers, they both unexpectedly fall in love, despite all the troubles around. An affair to keep hidden from everyone, though it was the beneficial in a way to those who are suffering. Practically impossible to keep it going, so how long and how it lasts follows in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nA completely different kind of the world war two drama I have ever seen. Not easy to accept, since we know how that war was fought. But it was really a good take, something softer and romantic side. Michelle Williams and Matthias Schoenaerts were too good in their respective roles. Well made film with the beautiful cinematography and music, especially the direction.\r\n\r\nThis film's special was its original source. That's an interesting story than this film. It was based on the book that published in 2004, but the manuscript was over 50 years old which was written during pre WWII. There are some tense moments, as well as romantically appeals, but the war influences all those to shape up the entire film. Surprised, because it was better than my anticipation. Only the end should have been improved. Like they concluded it by oral declaration, I would have liked them in the pictures, even it extends for another 15 or more minutes. Not recommended for everyone, but also not bad to try by everyone.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

            "review": "Hvem g\u00e5r det?\r\n\r\nThe Thing is directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and adapted to screenplay by Eric Heisserer. It's based on the novel \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell and is a prequel to \"John Carpenter's The Thing\" from 1982. It stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Ulrich Thomsen, Eric Christian Olsen and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Michel Abramowicz.\r\n\r\nAntartica, 1982, and scientist Kate Lloyd is requested to investigate something strange at a Norwegian base station. By accident the Norwegians have discovered what appears to be an alien craft frozen beneath the ice. Their thoughts prove to be correct and they are rightly celebrating a magnificent discovery, particularly as there appears to also be a frozen being in the ice. But it's not long before everyone at the base begins to regret unearthing the being...\r\n\r\nNo serious John Carpenter fan wanted this film, it wasn't needed or required. His 1982 film is an awesome slice of sci-fi horror, a remake itself of a very good film, \"The Thing from Another World\" (Howard Hawks 1951), Carpenter flipped the scenario around from Hawks' movie to great effect. Paranoia and creeping dread blended with amazing beasties to make for what many feel is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror movies going. So why remake it then? Well, we are told by Heijningen Jr and his team that this is a prequel to Carpenter's movie, asking the big questions such as just what happened at the Norwegian base station before Kurt Russell's manly mob got there? Making this a sort of filling in the blanks session. Not a bad idea at all is that, something good to work from, even if we know from the beginning of Carpenter's movie just how many Norwegian's survived!\r\n\r\nNow the problem here is that it may be a prequel, and attention to detail in scenes linking both films together is rather ace, but it's devoid of freshness, the makers pretty much following the exact same formula of Carpenter's film. Cue a group of scientist types getting spooked by something ghastly stalking them, cue one by one them getting offed in grizzly ways by an assimilating menace and cue paranoia and suspicion. They even put in the test sequence from 82, only with a metal slant instead of blood, while the creatures are the same only bigger in body horror terms and budget. Instead of Kurt Russell's mighty machismo, we get Winstead's spunky lady (she's the one without the face fuzz here), but it's the same old same old routine, only for the \"Scott Pilgrim\" crowd. When all is said and done, this is pretty much a remake of a far far better film.\r\n\r\nYet for all that is annoying and unadventurous about it, it's still a bunch of fun, the director is capable in having us wonder what is around the corner, utilising the cramped interiors for maximum fret. The various creatures born out of the Thing itself are monstrous, especially the two headed one which we see horrifically birthed, and even though the CGI is there, with some of it poor, much of it is blended with practical work and the human actors to stop it from being \"all\" about the effects. It's also nice to report that there is undeniably love and respect for the 82 cut. Leading cast performances are efficient, but Winstead is just too young and looks out of place, she does not, however, fail for lack of effort to make her thinly written part work. Bonus is the Norwegian actors adding some intense character dynamics to the plotting. Beltrami's score nods appreciatively to Morricone's original, and on Blu-ray Abramowicz's steely coloured photography really pings out of the screen.\r\n\r\nIn an alternative universe where there is no John Carpenter film, this would be a well regarded entry into the creature feature stable. With enough shocks and squirmy screams delivered for the genre eager crowd. But unless you are someone who hasn't seen Carpenter's superior movie, then this will feel like a shallow imitation, just like, ironically enough, one of The Thing's assimilated humans. A generous 7/10 from me because I did have fun watching in the privacy of my own home with the lights off. Other Carpenter fans, though, are most likely to start rating from my 7 and work backwards I feel..."

            "overview": "Several hundred years after the Battle of Dannoura, the Genji and Heike clans face off again in a poor mountain town with a buried treasure legend. A revolver-wielding stranger, a lone gunman, burdened with emotional scars and blessed with incredible skill, drifts into town and crosses paths with two warring clans who are both on the hunt for a hidden treasure in a remote western town. Knowing his services are valuable to either side, he offers himself to the clan who will offer up the largest share of the wealth.  Yoshitsune commands his Genji gang in white while Kiyomori leads his Heike gang in red. Expectations collide as the key players wonder which gang the gunman will join. Dirty tricks, betrayal, desire and finally, love, get jumbled together, as the situation erupts into a showdown.",

It has been on my \u2018films to watch\u2019 list for like a while after watching **Sing Street** - another **John Carney** film. And i did like his other film **Begin Again **(love the song Lost Stars). All have similar themes\u2026not just music, but the process of making music. \r\n\r\n**I love the simplicity of Once** -  feels more raw and natural (than Sing Steet and Begin Again). And the songs are really beautiful. I have been listening to it everyday. My top 2 favorite scenes are: Falling Slowly (video above) at the music shop - instant connection through music! Doesn\u2019t have to be a love story between the guy and the girl, just relate and connect for their love for making music. Second one would be the recording studio scene: When Your Mind\u2019s Made Up. I love how the guy who\u2019s \u2018pressing the buttons\u2019 was like meh just here to work with whatever wannabee band, and then when they start to play he\u2019s like\u2026what is this? this is actually good - support! And from there it\u2019s just something magical for all of them, that you know these musicians are in their element and will remember it for the rest of their lives, doing something that they are all so passionate about. Everyone inside the studio - just very endearing characters.  \r\n\r\nWell I love the whole film so all the scenes are great. My favorite emotional song, Lies. It\u2019s so powerful and heartbreaking, I think most relateable scene as well. \r\n\r\nJust might replace Garden State as my background film to play when I am doing something else, just to hear it. A must see for musicians and just music lovers like me."

I can watch them over and over again, and I will always laugh. I also love dark British humour, slapstick, and wait for it.... American.\r\n\r\nAmerican humour (especially these days) gets derided, most often due to it being \"dumbed down\" so the collegiate set can understand it, often using toilet humour as its best punchline. I somewhat disagree, I say that the humour people use between themselves is what drives movies made by Judd Apatow & co.\r\n\r\nTake Pineapple Express for example, this movie seems on some level to be fairly realistic. I use that term very loosely, because of course many things that happen in this film, could, and should never happen. Anyhow, the comedy, the dialogue, the fight sequences, and other interactions between the characters are the reasons I think make it feel this way.\r\n\r\nThe fight sequences aren't ones that I could say seem all that choreographed, of course there are \"X\" spots they need to hit, but for the most part I think it is done on the fly, or like much of the comedy, improvised.\r\n\r\nPineapple Express follows the story of a process server Dale Denton (Rogen), & his pot dealer Saul Silver (Franco), as they avoid henchmen (Robinson & Corrigan) of Ted Jones (Cole), Marijuana kingpin of L.A. after Dale witnesses a murder Ted commits. With a corrupt cop on the take (Perez) also on the hunt, staying alive for the buyer & supplier turned stoner buddies becomes an adventure of friendship as well as appreciation of the relationships built by people in this lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThe name Pineapple Express comes from the name of the variety of weed Saul introduces to Dale.\r\n\r\nI enjoy this movie because of the old fashioned approach taken to deliver the laughs and the story, and the characters feel very relatable to almost anyone on some level."

His job - to clean up the garbage the humans have dumped. In 700 years, he seams to have developed one tiny bug - a personality.\r\nJoin WALL\u00b7E in his interstellar quest to find a partner.\r\n\r\nWALL\u00b7E is short, satirical, dialogue-free and a visual masterpiece. And the fact that it is animated does not make it any less watchable as an adult.\r\n\r\nIt is a must watch for anyone of any age."

It dawned on me, when I wanted to check out an American film which, to my knowledge, had a plethora of fine acting, that this was written and directed by the same guy who made that film much earlier. Being raised Christian and hearing in the press over the past few years about misdeeds, especially involving leaders of the Catholic church (represented in films as diverse as 'The Boys of St. Vincent' (John N. Smith, 1992) and 'In Bruges' (Martin McDonagh, 2008), I was especially intrigued by this, his work of more recent vintage.\r\n\r\nThe ambiguity at the core of the film (and hence the 'doubt') really acts in the movie's favour. The script and direction are both tense and flawless, and the beautiful New York locations chosen to illustrate The Bronx in 1964 help air the play out, and give it more cinematic scope. It features some of the finest work I have seen from Philip Seymour Hoffman (though my favourites will always be 'Happiness' and 'The Master'), Meryl Streep (my most-esteemed works of hers are 'The Deer Hunter' and 'The Devil Wears Prada') and Amy Adams (this is her finest performance IMHO) as well as a breakthrough role for Viola Davis, who steals every scene she's in. This easily holds up well even with Shanley's Oscar-winning screenplay for 'Moonstruck', and, though dark and depressing, is thoroughly recommended for those who can stomach its subject matter, and peer into that abyss without flinching, as these fine exemplars of 21st-century American cinema so easily do here.\r\n\r\nThat it didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations is almost as ghastly, to the cinephile, as the misdeeds insinuated here are to the community at large. Must have been a strong year for film, methinks."

This is not a Disney film and that's one of the disappointments for the Tarzan fans. Because this film is for the grown-ups only. It is rated PG13, but still I don't think the children would enjoy it like they did for the recent 'The Jungle Book' film. So it is like a DC film, I mean, DC makes superhero films for the grown-ups, unlike Marvel's. The bottom line is, don't expect it to be like a Disney film. Like the director said before the release, this is not the Tarzan from your father, grandfather's era, but an updated one with strong graphic violence.\r\n\r\nSo the story skips all the Tarzan's earlier life like from his childhood to adulthood parts. The film commences with Tarzan being settled in the UK. It's the second half of the 19th century, where the European colonies in the Africa are expanding for its rich natural resources. So in the Congo savanna, the natives welcome Tarzan for his short visit, but the things get ugly when his wife, Jane was kidnapped. Now he must fight back for her safe return and also avert other threats in the region from the foreign power.\r\n\r\nThere are many CGI character films were made at the recent time, it is a trend, but not all of them are impressive. This film looked average when it comes to vfx. The story was acceptable, the performances were decent, the casting too not bad, but Samuel L. Jackson was completely useless. He's one of the greatest sidekick Hollywood ever produced, but I don't know why he's in this project, his role was very silly.\r\n\r\nIn other hand, Alexander Skarsgard was good in the lead character and so Margot Robbie as Jane. The action sequences were not good as I expected. The film had a good runtime, but in some parts, it was slow or maybe you can say nothing interesting thing happens. I liked the idea, to update the theme, but they should have given more focus on the story. I hope if they plan another film, it should be a prequel. Because I feel there's lots to learn about the past than going forward. This is a one time watchable film, there's no surprises, just plain and partially entertaining.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"
