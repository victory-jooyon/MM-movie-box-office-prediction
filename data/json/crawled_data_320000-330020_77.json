(Maybe for younger audiences)\r\n\r\nI understand that this is supposed to be a \"power of imagination\" kids story, but there is just a lot of garbage in this.\r\n\r\nThe kids seem to do some fairly good acting for what they're asked to do, but I'm not sure why George Lopez was cast, but the writing is weak enough that it could easily just be the writing.\r\n\r\nThe story is designed to look like it's just literally written haphazardly as they go, so it's hard to tell what's badly written, and what's correctly written to make it look like bad kid writing.\r\n\r\nWhile the characters of Sharkboy (especially) and Lavagirl are quite ridiculous, there are some fun things that they include throughout the movie, so its not like the movie is completely without quality, but piled together it was not an experience I'd want to do again."

However, it has been years since his last success and he is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma. A copyist is urgently needed to help the composer. A fictional character is introduced in the form of a young conservatory student and aspiring composer named Anna Holtz. The mercurial Beethoven is skeptical that a woman might become involved in his masterpiece but slowly comes to trust in Anna's assistance and in the end becomes quite fond of her. By the time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a door into his private world.",

            "review": "Homage or parody, Hot Fuzz is the best of modern British comedy.\r\n\r\nPolice Constable Nicholas Angel is the pride of the London Service, trouble is is that he is making everybody else look bad, so much so his superiors promote him to Sergeant in the sleepy village of Sandford, Gloucestershire. Yet all is not right with Sandford as the locals start meeting grizzly deaths, thus thrusting Angel into his biggest case so far.\r\n\r\nThe biggest question on most film goers lips was could the pairing of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg triumphantly follow the monster cult success of Shaun Of The Dead? Well the plot premise for Hot Fuzz hardly leaps out as something to grab the attention span of many, but they have crafted a tremendously funny film that winks at the action genre with genuine love and admiration.\r\n\r\nSimon Pegg and his trusty sidekick, Nick Frost, clearly have an earthbound appeal that many (even outside of Britain) can warm too, not pretty or over svelt, these guys are fans of movies making movies purely for the fans, and it shows. Neither Pegg or Frost try to steal scenes from each other, both men after over a decade of working together are clearly comfortable with their coupling and thus manage to fine tune their working chemistry.\r\n\r\nOnce Angel (Pegg) lands at Sandford Village we are introduced to a ream of British Village stereotypes (archetypes actually), all characters ripe for hilarious scenarios that our fish out water (big city cop) Sergeant struggles to comprehend. We observe as he is dumb struck at the ineptitude of the Village Police Force (erm service actually) and is then forced to work alongside dough eyed Constable Butterman (a film stealing Frost). Angel's exasperation at where he finds himself is mirthful joy to us the viewers. The dialogue is priceless, one liners and hat tipping nods to the action genre come thick and fast, in fact you can watch Hot Fuzz repeatedly and play spot the homage each time. I mean come on people, we got both James Bond (a delicious turn from Timothy Dalton) and Belloq in here strutting their stuff. The action set pieces are not found wanting either, director Wright having the time of his life with the crash bang wallop that flows in the final third.\r\n\r\nThe test of a great comedy is how it stands up to repeat viewings, to me Hot Fuzz delivers no matter how many times it is viewed. For even when you know what is coming up next, the smile on your face is already there before the event, wonderful, wonderful film made by guys who love movies as much as ourselves. 10/10"

            "review": "Americanized Pang brothers go mainstream and sadly the results are not very good. I actually wanted to like this film, because I enjoyed the Pang Bros. previous well-known horror film \"The Eye\" and for that reason alone, I had some really high hopes with this one too. Well, I guess it was my bad and I must say now that I'm genuinely disappointed; since I was expecting something that would be just as dark and scary as \"The Eye\", considering that we are talking about the same directors, but this time, they even had a bigger budget to work with. Proof that good directors can screw it up (or at least in my humble opinion) and that won't have anything to do with the financial resources.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Messengers\", the Solomon family, moves to an isolated farm, with the purpose of starting a new life and leaving an unpleasant memory behind. However, as soon as they arrive to their new house, the teenage daughter Jess, starts to experience some really odd situations and she claims to see people living inside the cellar. Creatures that are not in peace with themselves and need to give her a message before it's too late. However, her parents, who are pretty much fed up with her and her dreadful behavior, don't believe a word she says. Unfortunately, it is only a matter of time for them to realize that Jess may not be lying this time, after all and that there's actually something in that house\u2026something that has been waiting in the dark for a few years and is waiting to be released.\r\n\r\nI won't complain about the fact that these kinds of stories were already told about a thousand times. I'm not one of those movie fans who complain about the lack of innovation when it comes to the plot. Honestly, I think most films (especially horror films) out there, share a decent number of similarities and while many reviews comment on the simplicity and unoriginality of the plot, I will mainly focus on the fact that this film is overall not scary, which is my main concern. It seems like The Pang Bros. basically sold their talent to the devil, just to enter in the American film industry, without realizing that there was no need to copy the most superfluous and silly PG-rated contemporary horror flicks. \"The Messengers\" turns out to be one of those movies where nothing really happens...ever. It's just a nice variety of hallucinations and situations that end up being reduced to \"Did it really happen or was it just my imagination?\". No, I'm sorry but I just had about enough with these nonsense. I suppose the real action starts happening during the last twenty minutes, but that just doesn't do it for me. The denouement turns out to be somehow far-fetched and it left me with the hateful \"That's it?\" feeling inside my head. Overall, not the worst movie ever and it's not like it is unwatchable. It happens to be entertaining for moments and it has a small number of well-done ghostly sequences that made the whole thing endurable in some way. I also enjoyed the scenes with the crows, since they reminded me a lot of \"The Birds\", which is like partying with an old best friend, or something like that. The music during the opening and final credits is in my opinion the actual high point and that is not a very good sign, unfortunately. Another thing that is not exactly a good sign, would be the overhead microphone that can be seen more than once during the film. No comments about that little detail."

They walk, marching day and night in single file 70 miles into the darkest, driest and coldest continent on Earth.  Morgan Freeman narrates this amazing, true-life tale touched with humour and alive with thrills. Breathtaking photography captures the transcendent beauty and staggering drama of devoted parent penguins who, in the fierce polar winter, take turns guarding their egg and trekking to the ocean in search of food. Predators hunt them, storms lash them. But the safety of their adorable chicks makes it all worthwhile. So follow the leader ... to adventure!!",

I was worried that, as a fan of the original TV-series when I was a kid, I would be disappointed but it had actually captured the spirit of the series quite well. It was fun to watch, with a nice blend of comedy and action. Okay, the famous tank scene was perhaps a bit over the top but, what the hell, it\u2019s supposed to be an action film with a touch of comedy so...Naturally the so-called \"critics\" wrote it down, for instance on Rotten Tomatoes, but if you switch to the tab which shows what the actual audience said, it got a greater than 70% approval rating. IMDB also gives it a bit more than 7 stars out of 10 which I would say it\u2019s well worth."

Being so short, you don't get to know Ali Larter's character all that well and felt odd that Jill (Sienna Guillory) and Angie's (Sophie Vavasseur) absences weren't mentioned (that I can remember). **2.5/5**"

Is it possible for a modern audience fed on Gorno and Slice Dice horror genres to be objective also?\r\n\r\nWell I like to think that as a man in middle age I can be very objective and rate the film accordingly, so with that in mind I happily admit to being a member of both the above groups I have mentioned. This smacked of a bad idea when it was first mooted but it came as no surprise to anyone who can see that mainstream cinema had at this time in film history simply run out of great ideas for movies. This is real bad and I avoided it for so long, but the fact that his royal highness John Carpenter was lending his name to the project always kept me interested, it was the itch I was destined to scratch at some point.\r\n\r\nIt's poorly directed, badly acted, in fact there is a scene with four people on a boat (two of each sex) that is so badly acted you would be surprised if these actors ever work again! The pic is devoid of suspense, jump shocks and worst of all, an ending that is as dreary as it is insulting. I give it 2/10 for the sound mix only. An awful abomination."

            "review": "No splitting this Atom, it has got a rock solid heart.\r\n\r\nReal Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.\r\n\r\nSet in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....\r\n\r\nWe can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clich\u00e9s that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's very much perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are still young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's the robot Atom, the people's champion, yes it's David vS Goliath and yes! It's Balboa vS Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.\r\n\r\nThe cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences - even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over \u00a3180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode \"Steel\", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7/10\r\n\r\nHome format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production."

            "review": "The Grudge 2 resents its illogical plot for basic ineffective jump scares. Shimizu\u2019s western remake of his J-horror creation was one littered with promise, albeit irrefutably rough around the edges. Mediocre acting, snooze-inducing storytelling and jump scares aplenty. Japanese ghost children, that either croak as if exhuming a sore throat or scream like a domestic cat, popping their heads out of attics, entangling women in wavering hair and just being a general nuisance. Well, Shimizu begrudgingly brings Kayako and Toshio back for more ghoulish antics, as the fire initiated by Sarah \u201cBuffy or Daphne, your pick...\u201d Michelle Gellar somehow unleashed the dark spirits into the world. Essentially no longer restricted to the abandoned Saeki household, although still only haunt those that enter the house? I don\u2019t know, the logic is tossed out of the sh\u014dji at this point.\r\n\r\nInstead of remaking the original sequel for \u2018Ju-On\u2019, Shimizu and writer Susco opted for a more original take, answering the fundamental question that we all yearned to ask: \u201cgurl, where did you get that eye liner?\u201d. Turns out, dark spirits is the answer. What I supremely detest about this sequel is the direction the two aforementioned crew members decide to take the story. It\u2019s no longer about greeting death with a deep and powerful rage, cursing the location the spirits resides in. A semi-folklorish strand of Japanese traditions.\r\n\r\nInstead, to appease the simple minds of western mainstream audiences, they settled for a mundane supernatural progression that essentially tarnishes the original\u2019s plot in almost every possible angle available. Sure, Shimizu integrates some well-intentioned imagery that may or may not produce a chill or two. Namely the photograph sequence and bludgeoning someone with a frying pan during breakfast (what a waste of bacon!). Yet these are often accompanied by a predictable jump scare that relinquishes the horror. Kayako pouncing out of a photograph. Kayako wandering the hospital corridors bursting lightbulbs in her wake (not very cost-effective...). Kayako playing footsies in a Love hotel room. Kayako being Kayako. Once or twice was enough. Twenty times? Rapidly becoming unimaginative.\r\n\r\nThe non-linear intersecting sub-plots, imitating its predecessor, provided no twists to the narrative and, if anything, forced the pacing to be inconsistent with its constant switching between character perspectives. A classic peer pressure scenario which is enough to make anyone\u2019s eyes roll a hundred times.\r\n\r\nMagic mirror tricks, very unfashionable hoodies and an absolute waste of Buffy. The three elements that perfectly surmise the contents of this lacklustre sequel that boasts no genuine scares or tolerable execution. Again, stick to the original franchise."

It stars Christian Bale, Freddy Rodriguez, Eva Longoria, Chaka Forman, Tammy Trull, J.K. Simmons and Michael Monks. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Steve Mason. \r\n\r\nSouth Central Los Angeles, and best friends Jim Luther Davis (Bale) and Mike Alonzo (Rodriguez) begin hurtling into violence that threatens to derail their respective future plans.\r\n\r\nThis was to be David Ayer's directorial debut, and with him already boasting the writing credit for Training Day, the comparisons between the two are hard to ignore - but that's ok right?! Bale goes full tilt as the unpredictable and unnerving Jim Davis, a scarred Gulf War Veteran on a road to self destruction. Question is, will he take his best friend with him?\r\n\r\nThis is very much about Bale's barn storming show, which while it  thrills us greatly, it also hinders the Rodriguez characterisation of Lopez, making the pic a bit lop-sided. Narrative threads focus on the scrapes the pair get into, whilst in the background their love partners are waiting for their men to wake up and commit. Another features Davis suffering bad dreams from the war, all while he is head hunted by Homeland Security after he had failed to get into the LAPD. Davis firmly believes he belongs in the protection business, if only his habit for finding trouble wasn't so prevalent...\r\n\r\nThe violent action scenes are brisk and bloody, marking this out as a hard movie for sure, a hard movie with dialogue to match. Yet it's also a pic laced with black comedy, where there's a perverse pleasure in watching Davis and his not very bright cohort being bad boys. Longoria is not done any favours in the writing, but it's kind of ok since this really is about a friendship spiralling towards a day of reckoning that we obviously know is coming. Which when it comes to us, does not disappoint at all and leaves us some reflecting to do as the adrenaline finally slows down. 7.5/10"

While in despair at his failed attempts to save the business, Charles has a chance encounter with the flamboyant drag queen cabaret singer, Lola. Her complaints about the inadequate footwear for her work combined with one of Charles' ex-employees, Lauren, leads to a suggestion to change the product to create a desperate chance to save the business: make men's fetish footwear. Lola is convinced to be their footwear designer and the transition begins. Now this disparate lot must struggle at this unorthodox idea while dealing both the prejudice of the staff, Lola's discomfort in the small town and the selfish manipulation of Charles' greedy fianc\u00e9e who cannot see the greater good in Charles' dream.",

This was one of the early successes of the genre and it continues to shine today in ways other movies (I'm looking at you, Marvel) have not. \r\n\r\nThe grittiness of the story cannot be understated, this story is DARK. However, the message of the story is one of hope, and hope is a difficult thing to capture. This film captures both, with the help of excellent cinematography and slow-motion action cuts.\r\n\r\n I get the sense when I watch this film that something bigger is happening around me, and honestly in 2017, this movie feels more relevant than ever. Themes of state-run media empires, government corruption of the highest order, and the suffocation of all that is 'other' permeates the fabric of this film, and everything is captured beautifully in a noir-esque nightmarescape of future, facist London.\r\n\r\nI can honestly say that more than a decade later, this film still shines as one of the great comic book movies and its themes will continue to ring true as long as we have people in the world who exist to limit others. Let's just hope that someday this world does not feel any more real than it does now."

Max probably has a history of complying with his older friend Sydney, who (at the start of the film) suggests that they (along with their other friend Vince) kidnap an 8-year-old for ransom.\n\nLittle David was hand-picked by the group's current employer (Jones), and although Max is reluctant at first, a denied bank loan leaves him no choice but to comply. However, it soon becomes quite clear that David Sandborn is probably no ordinary child.\n\nThis kid seems to know everyone's past and future, and the group can't help but notice they're constantly hearing whispers that seem to be in the kid's voice.\n\nRoxanne (Max's girl) has been against this \"gig\" from the beginning (partly due to a bad feeling, partly due to having a history with Vince). Maybe her intuition is telling her that this particular kid will do anything he can to turn them against each other.\n\nYoung David has a certain outcome in mind, and he will manipulate anyone who tries to stop him. Whisper is simply a brutalizer of a film in which a seemingly normal child is bloodthirsty, and there seems to be no limit to what he can achieve. 7/10"
