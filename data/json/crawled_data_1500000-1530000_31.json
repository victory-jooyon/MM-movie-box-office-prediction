It is a quite entertaining little fantasy / supernatural / crime movie though. I am actually not sure what to classify at as. It starts of as a fantasy movie but is it really?\r\n\r\nThe cinematics of this movie is very good. For me it was the main part contributing to the enjoyment. The small world of these villagers is cinematically beautiful, dirty and gritty at the same time. The characters themselves with their enormous moustaches and weirdly cut hair are great. The special effects will perhaps not win any awards but they were good nonetheless. I especially liked the transformation scene during the meal somewhere in the middle of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bit of a roller coaster ride and sometimes it felt a bit disjointed. It was not really obvious why one scene or event was followed by another at all times. But then, taking into account the later events in the movie it was perhaps ment to be a bit disjointed and \u201cdreamy\u201d and I have to confess that I was extremely tired when watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit of a surprise. This is where the movie kind of went from a fantasy movie to more of a crime story. I have to say that I did not really see that coming until it was about to fall in my lap.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely worse ways of spending two hours in the evening, especially if you like movies that are not the typical mainstream Hollywood fare."

            "review": "Upon watching this film for a second time I realized just how much it reminded me of the famous \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast Orson Welles aired in 1939. With just the medium of radio he successfully created an atmosphere of panic so real people listening (who had not caught the beginning where it stated that the following was a radio drama) fled their homes thinking aliens from Mars had invaded Grovers Mill, New Jersey!\r\n\r\n\"Pontypool\" takes place almost exclusively inside a small radio station in the town of Pontypool, Ontario Canada. What starts out as an ordinary day slowly morphs into an extraordinary situation told almost entirely through eye witness call ins, a weather reporters sky view, and eventually the towns doctor who has a preposterous yet undeniably believable theory as to what is going on.\r\n\r\nDirector Bruce McDonald and writer Tony Burgess expertly create an atmosphere of frustration, disbelief, and panic all within the confines of a single set. Never once did I feel limited by not seeing what was going on outside. Like the aforementioned \"War of the Worlds\" radio drama, the situation unfolds by audio reports coupled with the unexpected entrance of the doctor.\r\n\r\nFor blood and gore fans there is a scene that is both shocking and heartbreaking. But this film is generally not for that audience... unless they have good imaginations and can be taken in by \"eyewitness\" accounts of brutality.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the tale that is refreshing is that the antagonism that is affecting the outside world is not a virus nor is it the dead come back to life. No... it is something... as the doctor explains... preposterous yet undeniably believable.\r\n\r\nThe casting of Stephen McHattie as the past his prime but not ready to go quietly DJ was a masterstroke. He brings to life Grant Mazzy in a way I cannot imagine another doing as perfectly. He mixes a jaded world view with pathos, anger, humor, and a just the right touch of madness as all around him slides into madness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in the IMDB trivia section, the writer admits to being heavily influenced by Orson Welles legendary radio drama when conceiving first the book, then radio broadcast, and finally film. It shows, as stated, and it shows gloriously."

So we were finally able to buy tickets BUT we were seated separately. It was fine though. The movie kept me entertained. Except for the guy near me who was snoring pretty loud, the movie was great.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Robert Downey Jr was amazing as always. There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together. But all in all I liked the movie. Seeing old characters from the first movie and new characters. I can't wait for a 3rd Iron Man movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B+."

Because I'm just not really feeling the love with this franchise. 15 years down the road since the first film and it still all feels a little unfocussed and silly to me, despite how beloved I know it is.\r\n\r\nThat all said, and though the villain here is certainly no Phillip Seymour-Hoffman of _M:I:III_, I still felt this was the strongest entry of the franchise so far. They even finally figured out that women can be used for more than just a damsel-in-distress, throwaway-set-piece or eye-candy. They haven't moved terribly far past that point, but at least they're changing it up a little. This fourth entry also adds a little levity, something a series that has always been a little dumb, is well served by.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

It has a touching side to it. Of course, I felt so happy seeing Robert Downey Jr. just being his plain hot self. He looks good when he's clean and he looks good when he's dirty.  And then there's Zach Galifianakis. I loved him in Hangover. He's super funny there. But I was surprised to watch him in this movie because not only is he in his funny self, he did a couple of crying scenes which were touching. \r\n\r\nThis movie is tiring. YES. Tiring. All the adventures and misadventures that they had made me really tired. My rate for this movie is B+. I can never give Robert a low rating hehehe."

The laughs are  plenty, if a touch juvenile, and there is at least an air of regressive reflection trying to make its point amongst the testosterone. \r\n\r\nIt does a job, just. 6/10"

Sure this has fans, and it's not my want to chastise people's personal preferences, especially with what makes them laugh, and certainly making light of serious issues doesn't have me signing up for the next PC Brigade march, but this is pathetically played.\r\n\r\nIt was a colossal failure at the box offices, and it deserved to be. Sandler and his writer, David Caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when Sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. It's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.\r\n\r\nNext to this Little Nicky looks a masterpiece! It's a tough film for Sandler fans to defend, and I have been one in the past, but when Vanilla Ice sending himself up is a highlight then you got problems. Whilst Susan Sarandon and James Caan should look in the mirror and ask questions about appearing in this... 3/10"

Those involved in the prank-gone-wrong make a pact to cover it up, but during graduation eight months later members of the agreement start showing up dead and it becomes clear that the killer knows their macabre secret.   \r\n\r\n\u201cSorority Row\u201d (2009) has the same plot as \u201cThe House on Sorority Row\u201d (1982), but the story & characters are totally different. I heard good things about this slasher, but was disappointed. Don\u2019t expect the worthwhile \u2018remakes\u2019 of \u201cMy Bloody Valentine\u201d (2009), \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d (2006), \u201cThe Fog\u201d (2005), \u201cFright Night\u201d (2011), \u201cHouse of Wax\u201d (2005) or \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (2009). \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s wrong with \u201cSorority Row\u201d? There\u2019s too much faddish shaky cam, which gets annoying; and the outdoor colors are faded, which is also annoying. The cast of females is decent, with Rumer Willis (Ellie), Briana Evigan (Cassidy) and Caroline D'Amore (Maggie) standing out (Audrina Patridge\u2019s role is too small to note), but the wannabe edgy tone makes it hard to warm up to any of them. It doesn\u2019t help that the directors don\u2019t know how to photograph women. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the ending \u201creveal\u201d is unconvincing and unsatisfying. There are other eye-rolling problems, like why Maggie would stand in front of car and risk death for no ostensible reason.   \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Pittsburgh area as follows: Homestead, Crafton (interiors), Washington (aerial views) and Soldiers and Sailors Museum and Memorial (graduation scenes).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"

Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is still continuing to do the bloody work of the dead John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). In his sights is William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), an unfeeling insurance head who turned down claims by Kramer and a myriad of others on pathetic technicalities. Cue more elaborate traps, painful decisions and some twisty devilment. Yep! It's another Saw movie.\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, part 6 is a step up in quality of writing and ingenuity of gore/trap factors from the previous two installments. It's still very much old hat as a formula, and once again the sequences of Bell used in flashback show him to be the franchise's strength. However, the makers put at the core an insurance issue that everyone can identify with, whilst piling on mystery and suspense by way of Jigsaw's left envelopes and the FBI closing in on an increasingly overt confident Hoffman. 7/10"
