            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAs you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I've at least \"liked\" almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998's Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. It must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. Any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. It must have something that makes the viewers think: \"I like this part that's not in the original\". Aladdin has a new arc given to Jasmine. Beauty and the Beast provides Beast with a better-developed storyline. Even The Lion King, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. Therefore, I was genuinely hyped for Mulan and what Niki Caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...\r\n\r\nI can't deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There's only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.\r\n\r\nFinally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams' score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn't get chills during the entire film. It didn't transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.\r\n\r\nHer courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.\r\n\r\nLike I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the \"be yourself\" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan's (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence.\r\n\r\nThe ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It's far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has made so far and by far. Even though Niki Caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. Technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2D animation from more than twenty years ago. The 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. The disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. The action scenes are packed with unnecessary CGI that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. The musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. Despite Liu Yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. Story-wise, it's a mixed bag. It's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a Disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. I praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. There are dozens of new additions that I sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. The message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment I can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...\r\n\r\nRating: C-"

This film was an eye opener for me. I mean all I knew was the marathon bombing, but I came to know that was only half, the other half was even more serious events that stretched for like a week after the original event.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the film was, there were no solo heroes in this story. Everybody contributed in some way to fight against the evil. The screenplay was shared by all the great actors, even small role ones equally. I loved how it all went on, as a team from different forces, but tackled the situation by joining the hands. I don't know it was only the film, but very impressive. That's patriotism!\r\n\r\nIn the opening, you could see different people from different places of Boston preparing for the big event. And then they all end up in the same place where a series of explosion goes up. Quickly the security agencies come together and investigate it. With a small clue, kicks starts the manhunt. This is the part I loved it. Hunting pisslam pigs are always so pleasure to watch.\r\n\r\nSuspense, thriller, the story was well paced and took forward with a wonderful ending. Awesome direction. Another hit in a single year alongside 'Deepwater Horizon'. Interesting, Wahlberg involved in both these films. I've also heard that the two screenplays was merged to make a single film. One was a drama and the other one was an action packed story. That's why it was well balanced between everything. From individual's story to together in the events. A must see film.\r\n\r\n_8.5/10_"

Obviously, the Russian team bet on using smaller resources to maximum gain. Not unlike the current Russian president's geopolitics, cough. The result is more than solid\u2014for a direct-to-DVD level superhero flick, that is.\r\n\r\n**The women:** gorgeous in a way which only Eastern European women can ever be\u2014combining the Scandinavian Valkyrie component with the finer feminine Slavic beauty. In short\u2014the next Trump-type can do worse than dip into the beauty pool of The Guardians.\r\n\r\n**The men**: dreamy types, blond and dark, muscular and lithe\u2014for all tastes.\r\n\r\n**The acting quality:** imagine the supporting cast of any generic direct-to-DVD film with Steven Segal, but worse by about 25%.\r\n\r\n**The action sequences:** world class.\r\n\r\n**The special effects:** more or less on par with the special effects from the first X-Men film from the year 2000, which back then cost $75 million to make. Apparently a decade and a half later technology has progressed enough to enable the plucky Russian team to achieve the same effects of\u2026the effects\u2026for a minuscule fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\n**The plot:** Soviet super-soldier experiments decades ago led to a bunch of amnesiac, un-aging men and women scattered around the country, who are gathered once more in order to stop the baddie who is wreaking havoc on New York, *sorry*, I meant Moscow. The baddie in question is like an uglier Bane, but with an approximation of the powers of Magneto.\r\n\r\n**The end result:** can it compete with the Marvel or DC films of today? Absolutely not. Is it good entertainment when measured by direct-to-DVD or TV film (or modern computer game) standards? Sure\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** back in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s Italian directors like Sergio Leone and Dario Argento proved that even if you have no budget and no actors and no coherent plot, you can still create world-class, even legendary cinema through sheer class.\r\n\r\nThe Guardians has no class whatsoever, but is a perfectly OK derivative adventure with superheroes and things going bang, and in an \"exotic\" setting at that. Maybe this is just the start of something cheap and beautiful?\r\n\r\nIf Russia becomes a world center for cheap knock-offs of Hollywood films, I for one would be happy with this development and would watch these films, because with smaller budgets and therefore less oversight by focus-group obsessed bean counters, interesting stuff may start to develop within the generic story skeletons, as once was the case with Italian films."

However, of what I saw, _Battle of the Sexes_ seemed to be little more than a collection of stereotypes played for comedy in a movie that not only wasn't funny, but probably shouldn't have even tried to be.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"

I saw it mainly because of how much I liked 'The Lego Movie'. This is not as good as that one, but cute little adorable animation. The film is exclusively for the kids and the families, but anybody can have a good time if they are not expecting according to their age, gender and other things. So if you are yet to watch, leave behind those in order to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing to do with the 2009 short film 'Partly Cloudy'. But those who wanted a feature film on the similar theme would enjoy it. It is a little different though. The storks who switched their business to another, 18 years later a chain of events makes them realise what they should be doing. So in an adventure, soon to be the boss, a bird named Junior struggles to fix his mistake. In the process, he unleashes some secrets which brings the final act where the narration decides which way to end.\r\n\r\nNot a bad story, which is a road adventure like many animation films. The comedies were good and the characters are well developed in the short span. Some parts seem very silly, but enjoyable. Particularly the wolf-pack and their weird approach to deal with things. The animation too was very smooth and overall film was short, so swiftly narrated tale. This is not the year's best animation, though watching it for entertainment would work. Animation fans should not miss it, and must see for little children.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

The only thing in their way is an anti-aircraft artillery unit of corporal Vaskov and five young women in training.

I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we\u2019ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don\u2019t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you\u2019ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn\u2019t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a \u201cMarvel\u201dous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would\u2019ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would\u2019ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn\u2019t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you\u2019ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn\u2019t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10."

            "review": "**A courtroom drama about who's right and who's wrong!**\r\n\r\nThere are many factors to consider, especially for a film like this. Yep, the film was based on the real courtroom event. The film is about two people to prove they're right on their book about the war crimes whether that took place or not. So all the episodes take place in a British high court with mention of Auschwitz concentration camp, particularly about its ruins than the events that happened in there. That means it's a great drama to learn about how these two fought in a lawsuit face-off, but there's nothing about the real event just like the film 'The Eichmann Show'. If you are not a Jew or a neo nazi or not even a European and North American, then this is an okayish film from the entertainment aspect, other than learning truth and history.\r\n\r\nI really expected some real events, but we have already seen in many films about Auschwitz camp. So they kept this film as a modern day court trial than mixing up with those old crime. Great acting by all. Timothy Spall nailed it in his negative role. He was just a fine supporting actor, till I started to recognise him since his genius display in a biopic, 'Mr. Turner'. This is his one of the top performances. He could play Don Trump in his biopic, beside Rob Redford who's a bit old for that. Rachel Weisz was okay. Her role was not strong enough, despite she's in the main character. Because everyone around her took the honour to rise above hers. Be it Tom Wilkinson, who was surprisingly awesome.\r\n\r\nSo in my perspective the film was good, but not great. The courtroom events lacked strong hold with what a film needs and what the viewers wants with twists and turns in the argument. But I'm very happy being honest than modifying its story to make film commercial worthy. Though the film had some its own moments, in the end it was not enough. Particularly how it concludes and to think why this trial even took place makes no sense at all. Seems more a joke than anything serious, just because of someone being crazily challenging and the other one responding to it. Anyway, it's still largely a sensitive matter and my view is just as an outsider. But the film is worth a watch, if you are not expecting a bigger picture after reading its synopsis.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

It's a family get together theme, but for the Christmas celebration. So after their mother recently passed away, all the children come to celebrate the festival with their father for not let him be alone for the occasion. But it is not a perfect family. They all seeing each other after a long time and they bring their works, issues and everything along. With differences, debate, fight and all hell set loose.\r\n\r\nI have seen plenty of similar themed films, this was no different, yet somewhat enjoyable. Because this kind of film is thematically same, but usually screenplay and the comedy parts are derived. If they make those parts right, then it'll meet somewhat viewer's expectation and do better at the box office. A decent cast, though Danny Glover presence was the film's highlight. Well created characters and the executions were not bad either. Surely you would laugh aloud in a few scenes. Bit a long film, but engaging plot. Overall an average film, yet the comedy parts was the best.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"

            "review": "**Moms don't quit! Quitting's for dads!**\r\n\r\nIt was more like a middle aged women's version of 'How to be Single'. So most of the younger audience won't get it, as well as the older people, because of the generation gap. I enjoyed it, but you know this is nothing close to any classic on the similar theme, just a decent entertainer though. From the director of '21 & Over', about the three moms whose children are in the high school, but it depicts those moms struggles over maintain the order in their professional and personal life.\r\n\r\nMila Kunis' character is the centre of the story, but I liked Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn as well. Basically, these three ruled the narration. Some of the comedies were good, though there are too much of sexual references in that. Not good as 'How to be Single', but definitely better than both the 'Bad Neighbours' films.\r\n\r\nIt got a mixed response, but a box office hit. Most of the story is predictable, though decently developed all the scenes by keeping them simple. I mean clich\u00e9 wise, but at some parts it gets loud and out of control. So make sure you are not watching for any inspiration, but the middle aged people feel more familiar with this than anybody else. Therefore, I think they're the target audience, and mostly the women.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

            "review": "The recently released Fifty Shades of Black is a comedy spoofing the romantic drama Fifty Shades of Grey which went on to become a super hit worldwide and collected close to $570 million. Principal photography of the movie started in August 2015 in Los Angeles. The film is financed by Octane which is a division of the larger IM Global production house. Stuart Ford, its CEO serves as the movie\u2019s executive producer. Open Road is distributing the movie in the United States. It is interesting to note that Open Road also distributed Wayan\u2019s 2013 parody \u201cA haunted house 1\u201d and its 2014 sequel \u201cA haunted house 2\u201d, both of which belong to the same genre as this movie. \r\n\r\nMarlon Wayans stars as the mysterious Mr. Black in this outrageous comedy movie. He is also one of the producers and is credited as a writer alongside his long-time producing and writing partner Rick Alvarez. Mike Tiddes who directed both the haunted house parodies is the director of this movie. Kali Hawk, Mike Epps, Affion Crockett, Andrew Bachelor, Jane Seymour, Florence Henderson, Fred Willard and Jenny Zigrino appear in this movie along with Marlon Wayans.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s soundtrack comprises of a combination of hip-hop and R&B songs. There are 10 songs featured in the album and is released by IM Global Music. The music has been curated by Format entertainment and IM Global Music. The soundtrack goes very well with the movie and is being appreciated by all people who love independent music.\r\n\r\nMarlon Wayans plays a secretive black entrepreneur in this erotic spoof comedy. He starts dating an inexperienced college reporter Hannah played by Kali Hawk. His unusual sexual practices shock Hawk\u2019s character and put a strain on their relationship. What happens when Hannah is taken through the maze of rough, hard and premature encounters inside Mr. Christian Black\u2019s playroom forms the crux of the movie. True to the genre, the movie parodies the original by taking into account the basic story premise, its characters and all the important scenes. Sample this. Hannah is bidding farewell to Black as the elevator doors are closing. Only, the doors are closing several times on Hannah\u2019s head.\r\n\r\nTrue to its tagline, the movie is way shadier than grey in its content and its treatment of the original book and its movie adaptation. It is not easy to spoof a popular movie with a great record at the box office. But Fifty Shades of Black lives up to its expectations and delivers on all counts.

It was a mix of cinematic, particularly in the opening and the end part, but the majority of the midsection is all about his stage performance. He posed like a secret agent named agent 0054, working in an important mission. So in the meantime, he takes the stage in Philadelphia and made gathered his fans laugh.\r\n\r\nSome jokes were good, but some were not. Overall, a nice show. It was for Kevin, otherwise, would have been a below average show. The film posters are parodies of 'The Dark Knight', 'World War Z' and 'Skyfall'. The opening credit too was a spoof of James Bond films. Nice effort to enchant the whole show. The Halle Berry's guest appearance was okay. I think worth watching it one time. Only for Kevin.\r\n\r\n**6/10**"

The message was awesome, but it's more like a personal. At least from the film's perspective about a couple and their struggle. Also the personalities of those two, who are so quiet, hence seems it was like a documentary film with a feature film touch. That does not mean Ruth Negga deserved the Oscars nominee. She got it only because of the black quota, otherwise there are many great performances to be considered who are not white, black or even American.\r\n\r\nSo coming to the film, I like this kind of drama, It was so realistic and I won't mind if it runs past two hour mark. The first appreciation must go the two lead actors, they were the soul of the film. Surely awards worthy performances, but like I said not the Oscars. Especially I loved the Joel Edgerton's part. It is one of his, maybe the best I have seen so far, For many reasons the people should watch this. Jeff Nichols of 'Take Shelter' fame did good in writing and direction, especially after his slightly disappointing previous film. One of the best biopic of the year and I recommend it not to miss, particularly for the family audience.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI still can't believe I'm about to write a review for The New Mutants... The last X-Men movie before they're introduced into the MCU became one of the most delayed films ever, but it finally got released this week. Shot in 2017 with an original release date of April 2018, Josh Boone had reshoots planned, which postponed the movie for the first time. Disney began negotiations to merge with 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), keeping the film in a limbo state. A global pandemic emerged, pushing the movie even further. Final outcome: a worldwide limited release three years after finishing shooting, and without any reshoots. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty low...\r\n\r\nSurprise, surprise, The New Mutants isn't a horrible mess, it's... fine! I feel really sorry that so many people worked on this film and had to wait so long to see it being released to the world. I love how it's far from being just another generic, formulaic superhero flick. Sure, it has tons of cliches, and it does still feel like an X-Men movie at times, but I'll get there. I genuinely appreciate that Boone and Knate Lee wrote a narrative packed with significant and detailed character development, including a compelling romantic arc. Every young mutant gets their own story explained front-center. Each time the film dives into a character's past, it never feels like an irrelevant subplot. It all serves a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe technical crew had a very low budget to work with compared to other movies in the genre, so I must praise them for transforming a small, one-location film into something surprisingly entertaining. The visual effects definitely don't have that quality that viewers are used to seeing now, but they're reasonably okay for the most part. The horror atmosphere is definitely present, but it feels like the movie could have benefited from a more assertive, bolder approach to these nightmarish sequences. The best aspect of the whole film is related to the indisputably talented cast, with just one exception...\r\n\r\nFrom Anya-Taylor Joy's rebel behavior to Charlie Heaton's experienced performance, passing through Maisie Williams' emotional display and Henry Zaga's charming one-liners, every one of these actors proves why they were cast in such a well-known franchise. Despite the ridiculously flawed accents, all share great chemistry between each other, including debutant Blu Hunt. However, the latter fails to be a compelling protagonist clearly due to her inexperience. I don't want to be too harsh on her because I did see some great moments when she shared the screen with her colleagues. However, I do need to state that every scene where she acts alone or against a green screen reaches cringe-worthy levels of bad acting.\r\n\r\nBoone and/or the casting crew must also take responsibility for choosing her as the main character, but honestly, she's not even my main issue. That has to do with her own character. While she gets the same focus as her fellow mutants when it comes to her backstory, she never really has to deal with her powers' consequences. Some mutants hurt or killed people, and they're unquestionably damaged because of it. Dani doesn't have a single moment where she feels sorry for whatever happened in her past or where she's confronted with it. It's quite hard to connect with a protagonist when both the character and the actress playing her lack that captivating personality.\r\n\r\nFinally, Alice Braga, as the doctor, is probably the most formulaic component of the movie. From the first conversation she has with the mutants, any viewer can guess where the story is going. Braga is good as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, but coincidentally or not, her character is the only one whose backstory wasn't remotely explored. Reyes' motivations and what lies beyond the hospital raise intriguing questions that, unfortunately, never get answered. Maybe the supposed reshoots could have solved some of these issues, perhaps they could have added some more. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that The New Mutants is far from being an awful mess.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Josh Boone and Knate Lee deliver a reasonably entertaining screenplay out of the generic zone of the superhero genre, packed with detailed character development and decent horror sequences, especially having in mind the low budget. The New Mutants features a marvelous cast, where everyone shares tremendous chemistry with each other. All actors deliver great performances, except for the debutant Blu Hunt who unfortunately lets her inexperience overcome her evident potential. Contrasting with the overall character treatment, Dani Moonstar fails to be a compelling protagonist since she's barely shown having to deal with the emotional consequences of her powers like every other mutant does. Despite the refreshing take on the overall story, there are still a few cliches and formulaic components throughout the film, especially related to the hospital. Overall, it's surprisingly okay considering the numerous production issues, so I definitely recommend it at least just to say goodbye to the last X-Men installment pre-MCU.\r\n\r\nRating: B-"

Though not a film of the year. It was like 'A Christmas Carol', except the past, present and future were replaced with different topics. And for each topic, separate set of characters with one twist at the end. The overall film was short and sweet.\r\n\r\nA successful businessman man who had lost his child seems not able to come out of the sorrow. His partners are worried for him, as well as the firm's future. So they come up with an idea to bring back their partner that they hire actors to help him recover. How the remaining tale turns out and the last part of the story brings an emotional ending.\r\n\r\nThere were lots of actors for just an 90 minute film. But everybody had a fair share. Nobody was greater than others. Smith had less dialogues as his role demanded that. From all, Winslet role was so ordinary, comparing her star value. Knightley was good, but her one of the dialogues about 'love' was awesome. Norton, Pena and Mirren, all were good in their respective parts.\r\n\r\nAn emotional film, but I don't think it appeals enough to everybody. As I'm being a fan of that theme, I felt it should have been a bit strong in those parts. Other than that it was a good film, a family friendly drama. It was not based on any book, though, looks like one. Surely worth a watch, especially if you love tearjerker films.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

He and other riders pause at a village, which comes under enemy attack. Confused and reeling from the sudden violence, he fails to find a unit under attack, which is surrounded and wiped out.\r\nHe is arrested, stripped of rank, and quickly sentenced to death by firing squad. He tries to appeal to his superiors, but is thrown into a dugout prison, guarded by a central Asian soldier. He narrowly escapes the firing squad when the Germans overrun the base, and he flees with his very reluctant guard.\r\nWandering from place to place, trying to avoid Germans, the two become comrades-in-arms, when they are recruited to take a village held by the Germans. \r\nBut duty is duty for his guard, and they continue on their journey to headquarters, encountering many village-level people and places. It's an episodic movie, which leads to an interesting ending in Berlin, years later. 7/10"

            "review": "When American audiences last saw our diminutive chopsocky champion in the iconic Jackie Chan he was kicking butt and taking numbers alongside ex-<em>Jackass</em> and <em>Dukes of Hazzard</em> star Johnny Knoxville in the flaccid and forgettable 2016 voltage vehicle <em>Skiptrace</em>. Well, the sixty-something martial arts megastar has found yet another frenetic farce to strut his stuff as he stars and co-produces in the vintage actioner <strong>Railroad Tigers</strong>, a vanity project that enlists his son Jaycee by his side as the nepotism card is dealt for the rollicking father-son tandem and their ragtag of hangers-on. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that <strong>Railroad Tigers</strong> is more of an entertaining roar than the aforementioned tiring and convoluted <em>Skiptrace</em> (this is not saying that much in terms of a compliment). However, the bad news is that <strong>Tigers</strong> does not challenge Chan and his high-strung hucksters to anything creatively crafty or freshly distinctive despite its nostalgic, stylish feel and loose ode to classic cinema that range from the old-fashioned <em>Robin Hood</em> movies to collaborative capers such as <em>The Dirty Dozen</em> and <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>. Still, <strong>Railroad Tigers</strong> is serviceable enough to satisfy watching the aging Chan and his applied magical mastery of chops, kicks and punches provide the escapist cartoon-inspired fight sequences that is the veteran actor's trademark trickery. <strong>Railroad Tigers</strong> is all-too-familiar film fodder for the Kung-Fu Crown Prince of Pain but Chan's off-kilter western chugs along in a Chinese-language action movie that systematically delivers more than it sputters to the finishing line.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that Chan has seen his better days in cinema as the maturing martial arts statesman continues to tinker around with formulas while still trying to keep his cinematic relevance in tact. One can definitely applaud Chan for his staying power on the big screen regardless of the classic hits, box office bombs or middling movies that have painted his film-making resume. Chan hooks up once again for the third time with his <em>Police Story 2013</em> and 2010's <em>Little Big Soldier</em> director Ding Sheng as he finds himself in a period piece centered around the exploits of a moving train. Indeed, <strong>Railroad Tigers</strong> is a rip-off of sorts and the premise is as predictable as one of Chan's acrobatic and comical kinetic pokes to the groin. Time does not stand still for anybody and that includes the combative senior citizen with the impish grin and stored bundle of energy that still oddly resonates on the big screen for Chan fans worldwide. Although it is understandable that we yearn for the young Jackie Chan of yesteryear with his <em>Supercop</em> identity one should try to appreciate the traveled actor's attempt to recapture his roguish reputation in a battered body that has seen its share of high-wire hedonism. \r\n\r\nIt is 1941 in eastern China where Ma Yuan (Chan) is the head porter for a rural railroad station. Ultimately, Yuan becomes the leader of a rebellious squad of railroad workers-turned-freedom fighters whose sole purpose is to hijack a Japanese supply train during the Sino-Japanese war effort in order to accommodate their fellow impoverished citizens. Furthermore, Yuan and his mischievous minions set their sights on the big prize--blowing to smithereens the bridge that serves as the major supply route for the train in crippling the Japanese transport system. The cockeyed crew are deep-rooted in craziness due to the fact that a.) the risky mission is suicidal in nature and b.) the fact that even professional soldiers are not ballsy enough to take on this kind of agenda against the mighty Japanese forces. Nevertheless, Yuan and his renegades undertake what is an ambitious albeit far-fetched gamble.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the combination of the clumsiness and caliber of choreographed fisticuffs of Chan and his cheeky charges is the physical source of appeal for this action/comedy military-western. Writer-director Sheng inexplicably takes a while to let the animated nuttiness roll before the wackiness is fleshed out along with the kooky characterizations that includes the offspring of Chan's in Jaycee as one of the maneuvering misfits that participate in this peculiar Far East <em>The Bridge on the River Kwai</em> knockoff. The supporting players contribute fairly effective to the farcical proceedings including Darren Wang's Chinese soldier that informs Yuan and his giddy group on the Japanese operations, Wang Kai's noodle distributor/sharpshooter Fan Chaun, Alan Ng's pick-pocketer San, Xu Fan's Xing'er (crushing on Chan's Ma) and Huang Zitao's tailor Dahai to name a few. Other noteworthy personalities featured in the mix are the villainous Japanese presence led by Hiroyuki Ikeyuchi's military law enforcer Yumaguchi and his femme fatale colleague in Zhang Luxin's Yuko. \r\n\r\nOverall, <strong>Railroad Tigers</strong> hits its stride as Chan and company gives their audience the desired ingredients to make this messy mayhem acceptable--awestruck stunt work, quirky-minded theatrics from the amusing Chan and an obvious nod to some of Hollywood's notable salute to train heist flicks and wartime fables that stimulate more than sedate. These <strong>Tigers</strong> claw their way into a frivolous lather but whether or not Chan's latest spectacle deserves a boarding pass to enjoy the same blueprint thrills...well, hey...would you rather see the sequel to <em>Skiptrace II</em>? We rest our case...      \r\n\r\n<strong>Railroad Tigers</strong>\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 5 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jackie Chan, Jaycee Chan, Zitao Huang, Kai Wang, Darren Wang, Hiroyuki Ikeyuchi, Zhang Lanxin, Alan Ng, Zhang Yishang, Fan Xu, Sang Ping, Wang Ta Lu\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ding Sheng\r\n\r\nWritten by: Ding Sheng and He Ke Ke\r\n\r\nDistributed by: Well Go USA Entertainment, Beijing Sparkle Roll Media, Shanghai Film Group Co., JQ Pictures LTD.\r\n\r\nProducers: Jackie Chan, Qi Jian Hong, Ren Zhong Hun, Song Ge.

Mystery is often its own reward, and I do believe that's what writer/director Trey Edward Shults was going for here, but it didn't wind up hit that resonant for me. This particular movie felt like it wasn't about the journey, it was about the destination, and we essentially didn't get one.\r\n\r\nJoel Edgerton is fantastic of course, but any one of the other actors could have been as well, we'll never know because they were never given that opportunity. Which really says it all with _It Comes at Night_. There seemed like there was something very worthwhile just on the other side of the veil, but we'll never know, because we never got to see it. And with cinema, if we didn't see it, does it really count?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

            "review": "**He finally found his place, and now it's in jeopardy!**\r\n\r\nThe fourth feature film for the Kiwi director Taika Waititi. I loved all his films except the previous one, despite it was a famous title that the world loved, I'm not. So according to me this is a great comeback after a cheap vampire mockumentary. I was very confident that this would take up the New Zealand's the Oscars slot and then disappointed to find it was not in the initial list released by the Academy. Anyway, it does not need a tag like that, it is really an awesome film for everyone, though the theme has some adult contents in an indirect manner and violence like killing the wild animals. That means still it can be watched by kids with their parents' consent.\r\n\r\nWatching it takes you to the location live, so you don't want to end your vacation in the beautiful New Zealand wilderness which feels like untouched. It was nothing like you have seen in 'The Lord of the Rings' that altered with the computer tricks. This is raw and beautiful like the Tasmanian jungle from 'The Hunter'.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an orphan boy named Ricky Baker, who is a troublesome. Finally a family from the remote place adopts him where with the initial hiccups, he started to get used to it. But after one of the members dies in his new family, the child service wants him back. This is where it all begins, because he finally found a place where he belongs, but they are trying to take it away from him. So he launches his protest that comes from a mistake which later becomes a national news. What's going to happen to him and the others around him told in the remaining part.\r\n\r\n> \"Sometimes in life it seems like there's no way out. Like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.\"\r\n\r\nSeems Ricky is obsessed with the films. He always talks about them and compares his actual state of condition to the different films he had seen and admired. Especially about the gangsters, I think that's why he became so rebellious, apart from his struggles in the orphanage. This film was based on the book called 'Wild Pork and Watercress' and I praise the author for creating a character like Ricky. As usual the screenplay by Taika Waititi was amazing. Not without the support from his crew and especially the actors like who played Ricky. So was the Sam Neill in an important role.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it is a fun film, despite whatever they have shown in this like about the feud between the child service and the kid. The film kind of looks like Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' without his signature. Except the initiation, what follows is quite aimless plot. So, not easy to predict the scenes, but somewhat we come to know the ending. It has to conclude either way, like happy or sad ending, or maybe both. But the overall film keeps us in the guessing mode, providing some laughs and thorough good entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt's really an appealing title and so the equally satisfying film. Especially if you like wild and green landscape, you should not miss it. The story was told in chapters which actually did not require, but those slices were helped to understand each section and its focus. I think it was a direct influence from the original source.\r\n\r\nThe director is now on a big leap, doing a superhero film in the Hollywood. The third 'Thor' film, that reunites him with Sam Neill for the second consecutive time. I'm waiting for that which is going to be a visual extravaganza. He has done great with smaller films till now, which are mostly the comedies, but what comes is his biggest challenge so far and if he does pull it off successfully, he would be another Kiwi director in the big league after Peter Jackson. Praying to happen that. In the meantime, I recommend you to check this one out.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"
