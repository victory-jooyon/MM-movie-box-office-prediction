It is a quite entertaining little fantasy / supernatural / crime movie though. I am actually not sure what to classify at as. It starts of as a fantasy movie but is it really?\r\n\r\nThe cinematics of this movie is very good. For me it was the main part contributing to the enjoyment. The small world of these villagers is cinematically beautiful, dirty and gritty at the same time. The characters themselves with their enormous moustaches and weirdly cut hair are great. The special effects will perhaps not win any awards but they were good nonetheless. I especially liked the transformation scene during the meal somewhere in the middle of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bit of a roller coaster ride and sometimes it felt a bit disjointed. It was not really obvious why one scene or event was followed by another at all times. But then, taking into account the later events in the movie it was perhaps ment to be a bit disjointed and \u201cdreamy\u201d and I have to confess that I was extremely tired when watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit of a surprise. This is where the movie kind of went from a fantasy movie to more of a crime story. I have to say that I did not really see that coming until it was about to fall in my lap.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely worse ways of spending two hours in the evening, especially if you like movies that are not the typical mainstream Hollywood fare."

            "review": "Upon watching this film for a second time I realized just how much it reminded me of the famous \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast Orson Welles aired in 1939. With just the medium of radio he successfully created an atmosphere of panic so real people listening (who had not caught the beginning where it stated that the following was a radio drama) fled their homes thinking aliens from Mars had invaded Grovers Mill, New Jersey!\r\n\r\n\"Pontypool\" takes place almost exclusively inside a small radio station in the town of Pontypool, Ontario Canada. What starts out as an ordinary day slowly morphs into an extraordinary situation told almost entirely through eye witness call ins, a weather reporters sky view, and eventually the towns doctor who has a preposterous yet undeniably believable theory as to what is going on.\r\n\r\nDirector Bruce McDonald and writer Tony Burgess expertly create an atmosphere of frustration, disbelief, and panic all within the confines of a single set. Never once did I feel limited by not seeing what was going on outside. Like the aforementioned \"War of the Worlds\" radio drama, the situation unfolds by audio reports coupled with the unexpected entrance of the doctor.\r\n\r\nFor blood and gore fans there is a scene that is both shocking and heartbreaking. But this film is generally not for that audience... unless they have good imaginations and can be taken in by \"eyewitness\" accounts of brutality.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the tale that is refreshing is that the antagonism that is affecting the outside world is not a virus nor is it the dead come back to life. No... it is something... as the doctor explains... preposterous yet undeniably believable.\r\n\r\nThe casting of Stephen McHattie as the past his prime but not ready to go quietly DJ was a masterstroke. He brings to life Grant Mazzy in a way I cannot imagine another doing as perfectly. He mixes a jaded world view with pathos, anger, humor, and a just the right touch of madness as all around him slides into madness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in the IMDB trivia section, the writer admits to being heavily influenced by Orson Welles legendary radio drama when conceiving first the book, then radio broadcast, and finally film. It shows, as stated, and it shows gloriously."

So we were finally able to buy tickets BUT we were seated separately. It was fine though. The movie kept me entertained. Except for the guy near me who was snoring pretty loud, the movie was great.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Robert Downey Jr was amazing as always. There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together. But all in all I liked the movie. Seeing old characters from the first movie and new characters. I can't wait for a 3rd Iron Man movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B+."

Because I'm just not really feeling the love with this franchise. 15 years down the road since the first film and it still all feels a little unfocussed and silly to me, despite how beloved I know it is.\r\n\r\nThat all said, and though the villain here is certainly no Phillip Seymour-Hoffman of _M:I:III_, I still felt this was the strongest entry of the franchise so far. They even finally figured out that women can be used for more than just a damsel-in-distress, throwaway-set-piece or eye-candy. They haven't moved terribly far past that point, but at least they're changing it up a little. This fourth entry also adds a little levity, something a series that has always been a little dumb, is well served by.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._"

It has a touching side to it. Of course, I felt so happy seeing Robert Downey Jr. just being his plain hot self. He looks good when he's clean and he looks good when he's dirty.  And then there's Zach Galifianakis. I loved him in Hangover. He's super funny there. But I was surprised to watch him in this movie because not only is he in his funny self, he did a couple of crying scenes which were touching. \r\n\r\nThis movie is tiring. YES. Tiring. All the adventures and misadventures that they had made me really tired. My rate for this movie is B+. I can never give Robert a low rating hehehe."

The laughs are  plenty, if a touch juvenile, and there is at least an air of regressive reflection trying to make its point amongst the testosterone. \r\n\r\nIt does a job, just. 6/10"

Sure this has fans, and it's not my want to chastise people's personal preferences, especially with what makes them laugh, and certainly making light of serious issues doesn't have me signing up for the next PC Brigade march, but this is pathetically played.\r\n\r\nIt was a colossal failure at the box offices, and it deserved to be. Sandler and his writer, David Caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when Sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. It's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.\r\n\r\nNext to this Little Nicky looks a masterpiece! It's a tough film for Sandler fans to defend, and I have been one in the past, but when Vanilla Ice sending himself up is a highlight then you got problems. Whilst Susan Sarandon and James Caan should look in the mirror and ask questions about appearing in this... 3/10"

Those involved in the prank-gone-wrong make a pact to cover it up, but during graduation eight months later members of the agreement start showing up dead and it becomes clear that the killer knows their macabre secret.   \r\n\r\n\u201cSorority Row\u201d (2009) has the same plot as \u201cThe House on Sorority Row\u201d (1982), but the story & characters are totally different. I heard good things about this slasher, but was disappointed. Don\u2019t expect the worthwhile \u2018remakes\u2019 of \u201cMy Bloody Valentine\u201d (2009), \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d (2006), \u201cThe Fog\u201d (2005), \u201cFright Night\u201d (2011), \u201cHouse of Wax\u201d (2005) or \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (2009). \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s wrong with \u201cSorority Row\u201d? There\u2019s too much faddish shaky cam, which gets annoying; and the outdoor colors are faded, which is also annoying. The cast of females is decent, with Rumer Willis (Ellie), Briana Evigan (Cassidy) and Caroline D'Amore (Maggie) standing out (Audrina Patridge\u2019s role is too small to note), but the wannabe edgy tone makes it hard to warm up to any of them. It doesn\u2019t help that the directors don\u2019t know how to photograph women. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the ending \u201creveal\u201d is unconvincing and unsatisfying. There are other eye-rolling problems, like why Maggie would stand in front of car and risk death for no ostensible reason.   \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Pittsburgh area as follows: Homestead, Crafton (interiors), Washington (aerial views) and Soldiers and Sailors Museum and Memorial (graduation scenes).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"

Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is still continuing to do the bloody work of the dead John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). In his sights is William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), an unfeeling insurance head who turned down claims by Kramer and a myriad of others on pathetic technicalities. Cue more elaborate traps, painful decisions and some twisty devilment. Yep! It's another Saw movie.\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, part 6 is a step up in quality of writing and ingenuity of gore/trap factors from the previous two installments. It's still very much old hat as a formula, and once again the sequences of Bell used in flashback show him to be the franchise's strength. However, the makers put at the core an insurance issue that everyone can identify with, whilst piling on mystery and suspense by way of Jigsaw's left envelopes and the FBI closing in on an increasingly overt confident Hoffman. 7/10"

I mean, the description even mentions the Coen brothers as a basis for comparison. With Jeff Bridges' role, it was difficult not to think of The Big Lebowski, but this film isn't of that caliber.\r\n\r\nStill, I thought it was entertaining most of the time. There were slow interludes that could have been removed to improve the pacing without harming the story. But if you understand that they aren't going for laugh out loud gags or one-liners, but rather they work for their punch lines or leave you to figure out where the joke is, maybe you can appreciate it more.\r\n\r\nI will say that the plot seemed a bit disjointed to me. The flashbacks weren't confusing, but in a slower paced film like this one, I think they were sometimes more of a distraction than plot-enhancers. The ending also had an air of an anticlimax to it, like - oh, okay. I guess it fit the laid back mood of the rest of the movie, but they might have done more with it.\r\n\r\nStill, I liked it. Enough said."

There are some good parts in the movie and, of course, the special effects are more up to todays standards. However it lacks a lot of the appeal, the over the top gory violence and the cartoonish wow-factor that the original has. I guess it is because they wanted that silly PG-13 rating in the hope of raking in more cash. It is not the first time Hollywood greed have ruined a good movie unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the movie is not bad. Taking out Murphy with a simple car bomb was rather disappointing though. Again here the movie lacks the gritty and brutal aspect that the original had. The parts where Murphy is awaken in the secret(?) research and manufacturing facility and him freaking out when discovering what he as become was enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThen it really starts to go downhill in what I usually refer to stupid Hollywood scripting. Ten minutes before Robocop is about to make his public debut then they do a huge info dump into his brain? That is just so poor unintelligent scripting. Of course it went to hell.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are quite okay but again the scripting is just nonsense. Most of the time this highly intelligent combat cyborg is just rushing straight into the fire blasting away like some Terminator/Rambo wannabe. Sure it makes for some good firefights but it is still poor scripting.\r\n\r\nThen the ending. What was that? I do not refer to the actual ending where Murphy, luckily, prevails but the part after that with the TV-presenter (or whatever he was in the end) rambling on about traitors etc. That was just there to show the audience that they hoped to do a sequel but the nonsensical outburst did not really much sense. Actually I thought that those TV-presenter scenes where generally just a nuisance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is not really a bad movie but it is sorely lacking the appeal of the original. Too a large extent this is due to it being reduced to a teenage no-rude-language-please type of movie lacking the dark and gory aspect of the original. The poor script doesn\u2019t help of course. I am not sorry that I spent time watching it but the feeling afterwards where a bit\u2026meh."

Dervla Kirwan plays the ex-wife, Tony Curran the \u201cstepdad\u201d and Stephen Rea the guiding priest.\t \r\n\r\nWritten & directed by Neil Jordan, \u201cOndine\u201d (2009) is a lyrical coastal drama/mystery reminiscent of \u201cThe Seventh Stream\u201d (2001) and \u201cThe Secret of Roan Inish\u201d (1994). It mixes the haunting seaside fisherman element of \u201cOrca\u201d (1977) with the coastal mysteriousness of \u201cHalf Light\u201d (2006), the romance of \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d (1999) and the melancholic folk of \u201cMcCabe & Mrs. Miller\u201d (1971).\r\n\r\nThe filmmaking is artsy with seeming ambiguities, sometimes annoyingly so (depending on your taste), while exploring the concept of wish fulfillment in the face of grim realities. Bachleda\u2019s beauty is tastefully displayed.\r\n\r\nThe characters speak in Irish/Scottish brogue and the dialogue is often realistically mumbled, making it difficult to understand for outsiders. Unfortunately, there are no English subtitles on the disc; so if you watch it via streaming I advise using subtitles. \r\n\r\nThe folk-oriented soundtrack sometimes throws in a welcome oddity like \u201cBathe in Blood\u201d by Evile and \"Then Comes Dudley\" by The Jesus Lizard. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot at Beara, County Cork, Ireland. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

Honestly though, it's like they had someone write a really great Dungeons and Dragon movie, and then tried to ruin it with humor page by page.  There is a 9/10 star movie hidden in this, if they would do a (slightly) more serious story.\r\n\r\nDanny McBride and James Franco basically do what they normally do, but in jerkins: I'm pretty sure they don't even really have accents compared to everyone else.  Franco has a fluttery tone that Zoey Deschanel mirrors, but she is just a living macguffin with two solid jokes.  There is a parody of this where they just replace her with a sex doll and pause when she's supposed to have lines.\r\n\r\nNatalie Portman is about 10 times the actor than everyone else in this movie, and I don't know what got her to slum it in this other than it was a unique opportunity to be a bad ass D&D style woman character.  I honestly would have liked to see a movie franchise based on her character.  She makes a great straight man to the band of idiots, given to much more subtle humor, but she plays off of the others' dirt humor really well.  And don't get me wrong, she is a legitimately funny actor.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is a bit formulaic for an RPG adventure, but it is filled with great characters and villains, and I legitimately think I'll turn this movie into a campaign adventure somehow.  Lazar is actually a really well crafted villain with a decent support structure of henchmen and resources, despite having a rather basic end goal.\r\n\r\nMa-Tee-Tee, as over dramatic as he is, may be one of my favorite villains.  He's a leader, he apparently crafted an entire society to his choosing, and either gained or created his power, and what's more he actually created a system (though unfair) that allows a chance for actual warriors to fight their way to freedom.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to love about this movie, and then there is all the stuff they added for attention seeking comedy."
