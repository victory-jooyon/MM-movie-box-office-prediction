I felt that the story was copied from lots of Malayalam movies such as Kammatti Paadam, for example the narration part the way the movie starts making up gangs picking up fights then the 2 way love from premam and many movies like that plus to mention the foodies scenes shown in the movie seen a lot like that in salt and pepper and ustad hotel and many more. This movie was trying to bring a new slang into the Malayalam industry for me it felt as the worst slang ever nothing is clear to understand. Each scene ends in cursing and total violence it\u2019s not good for family audience. But I was able to learn that we could make 4 cores by just selling pork if that was the scene the whole of Kerala would have sold pork and got rich makes no sense. Don\u2019t know how this movie was a hit in the Malayalam movie industry it was complete nonsense and filled with lots of garbage. It was a mixture of lots of Malayalam movies they just wanted to fill up the given movie time with garbage that\u2019s all. After seeing this movie I have a complete bad reputation on the place Angamaly in Kerala and the people there. I personally would not suggest this movie to anyone cause if I do your going to end up cursing me.\r\nNotable acting\r\nNobody extremely disappointed by everyone\u2019s acting \r\nGenre: Action, Comedy and Thriller\r\nMy Rating: 1/10"

But still like Gerard Butler, even though he seems to be getting... um, puffier lately, Morgan Freeman as always was good and Nick Nolte had a couple fun scenes. Shame, for whatever reason, they couldn't get Radha Mitchell back as Banning's wife, she at least wasn't as a stark difference from when Rachel Weisz was replaced by Maria Bello in that third Mummy movie... This was a serviceable enough action-thriller but nothing special on the whole.\u00a0**3.0/5**"

The sort of thing that'd usually earn all of its points out of pure catharsis, but is to confronting to be any way actually cathartic, and hits the message over and over again instead, which normally I hate, but _Assassination Nation_ works because of the hate. It's a very hateful movie, with just a sliver of what you might have expected it would be like based on the trailer right at the very end, but otherwise, grim.\r\n\r\nIn a good way though. A way that works, makes you think, but still has all #TheAesthetic\u2122 you can shake a stick at, it just makes you feel bad for shaking that stick. Do you like _The Purge_ but feel that the mirror it holds up is too general? Wanna feel bad about feeling good? Give _Assassination Nation_ a crack.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"

I knew he shot that dude and the dude he shot is the one who had to apologise somehow, and that he was one of the evil puppet-master types who stood behind George W. That's it. So while Cheney as a subject matter isn't something I can say I **care** about, it's also not material that's old hat to me either. I ended up watching it only because that's what my mate wanted to do for his birthday, but I'm glad I did. I did not **love** _Vice_, but for the sort of thing I don't normally gravitate towards, I was riveted.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

However, in order to become a diamond, anyone, even the most outstanding brilliant, needs to be cut, and the way to the legendary stage of The Bolshoi Theatre for Yulya lies through the walls of the ballet school, where the more capricious teacher Galina Mikhailovna Beletskaya takes custody of the rebellious provincial.  Turning into a prima will require incredible self-denial, and Yulya herself will have to make sure that the big ballet is not only the whiteness of the packs, the gold of the boxes and the slip of silk ribbons. But no obstacles will stop the one who has the big dream.",

It has some laughs in it, but it's far from a comedy.\r\n\r\nIt's all \"what\" and no \"why\", but also, _The Post_ is built on this HUGE will-they-wont-they question with massive ramifications (\"Will Nixon and LBJ be exposed\") and it's what the whole 108 minute runtime is building up to, but... We already know. The things that happen in _The Post_ are real events that are common knowledge. So it's kind of... The mystery of the moral quandary was answered before you ever pressed play. I think with the state of journalism and even more so the state of politics the way it is now in America, that _The Post_ was a very timely film, and with a cast like this assembled, obviously nobody in it is bad.\r\n\r\nBut does _The Post_ deserve the awards consideration it has gotten? Personally, I don't think it does.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"

Once the secret is revealed, the character takes some questionable actions. Actions that seem like the introduction to a super villain movie.\r\n\r\nIt's not a film I'd watch again, but not a film I'd consider a waste of time. I might give the viewers something serious to talk about."

Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) gets a look-in once again after her very disappointing absence from 99.99% of \u2018Endgame\u2019, but she\u2019s wasted on screen, serving little to no purpose. And while this film finally gives us a Peter/MJ love story, it\u2019s all too familiar territory - not because of the characters involved but because we saw Peter pursue a crush in \u2018Homecoming\u2019. We also saw him try to balance the student/hero sides of his life then too. This is THIS Peter Parker\u2019s fifth time on the rollercoaster. We\u2019ve seen him and fell in love with him as the sweet, innocent kid who had greatness thrust upon him and his thirst to be a superhero. He had his shot in the ring - several times in fact - and now we need to see him grow, but they\u2019ve just given us much of the same. We need to know where this is going, not just watch a kid play dress-ups time and time again.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-spider-man-far-from-home-in-a-post-iron-man-world-spideys-still-the-same-insecure-kid"
