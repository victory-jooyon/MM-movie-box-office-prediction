At least in Life Aquatic they wore funny outfits. Being a world traveler myself I could appreciate the jet lag and overall moping around thru out the whole film. You will definatly feel lost. Although I found myself laughing out loud a few times at Bill Murray and his quips, BY NO MEANS should the average movie fans think this is a comedy. It is an independent art film and should be treated as so."

While there\u2019s a little nudity done for laughs, it lacks the sleazy/bathroom humor of romcoms that would\u2019ve been superior if they didn\u2019t stoop to that low level of non-humor, like \u201cShe\u2019s Out of My League\u201d (2010). \r\n  \r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes, and was shot at The Hamptons, Long Island & New York City; Warner Brothers Burbank Studios & Santa Monica, CA; and Paris, France.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

They, and fellow members of the Knapely Womens Institute, will pose in some strategically nude pictures and sell them as a calendar!\r\n\r\nBased on a true story, and following on from the roaring success of 1997s The Full Monty, it was a story just begging to be adapted for the big screen. Also boasting a shot in the arm for actresses of a certain age, who sadly are bereft of decent cinematic parts, Calendar Girls may not be a masterpiece of homely cinema values, but it certainly warms the cockles and hits an entertaining spot in spite of the laborious last third. The cast are uniformly excellent, Julie Walters, Helen Mirren (gorgeous), Linda Basset, Annette Crosbie and Geraldine James are particularly memorable in telling this tale of a close-knit village quite unsure on how to deal with a touchy subject. From there the press sensationalism arrives and this shifts the girls (and sadly the film) to another plane.\r\n\r\nThe picture manages to be that rare old thing of a comedy drama actually impacting heavy on both fronts. The comedy moments are joyous and flow frequently for the first two thirds of the picture, whilst the touching drama, of what is a serious subject at its core after all, really touches a nerve. Sadly as we enter the final third, the makers tag on an unnecessary dissection of friendships and relationships, and it nearly costs the film dear. It does survive, mainly due to the wonderful cast and the integrity laden point of view, making it a film that once viewed is clearly not going to be forgotten. So in the main we should all hail those wonderful Calendar Girls. 7/10"

When coming to the story fully packed once when we got that situation really no one will going to surive us. An excellent actions,stunts,technology,etc. It is totally a full pack \"FIRE SALE\".:) Superb MOVIE"

The story is good, and the way they go about investigating the mystery is good in the traditional sense: a good cycle of drip fed information, search and discovery.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the haunting itself isn't that interesting, but it is somewhat compelling that it has a \"Beauty and the Beast\" vibe to it, and Terence Stamp does \"creepy old guy\" very well.\r\n\r\nThe kids are fun, and the movie has a certain amount of charm to it, but nothing about the movie really stands out as amazing."

            "review": "There's always the next something, Maggie. And that will take a man away.\r\n\r\nThe Missing is directed by Ron Howard and adapted by Ken Kaufman from the novel The Last Ride written by Thomas Eidson. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Cate Blanchet, Eric Schweig, Evan Rachel Wood, Jenna Boyd, Ray McKinnon, Val Kilmer & Aaron Eckhart. James Horner scores the music and Salvatore Totino is the cinematographer.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico 1885 and frontier doctor Maggie Gilkeson (Blanchet) has to seek help from her estranged father Samuel Jones/Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan (Lee Jones), when her eldest daughter is kidnapped by Pesh-Chidin/El Brujo (Schweig) an Apache Warlock who sells girls into prostitution.\r\n\r\nAn obvious variation on John Ford's The Searchers, The Missing slipped under the radar some what of Western fans who were greatly served by Kevin Costner's Open Range released the same year. It was a box office flop; which in a genre that has rarely hit great heights in modern times is hardly surprising, but to dismiss Howard's film as a fop is just wrong. True enough it's hardly original on the page, but it manages to not sacrifice character depth as it crams in the Western staples. While there is plenty enough here for none Western fans to enjoy; from the many colourful characters on show (including a great horror movie like villain in Schweig), to the panoramic scenery, and the number of action sequences that flit in and out of the narrative. There's a little something for most movie loving fans.\r\n\r\nThe cast, too, are value for money. Blanchet gives it guts and layers as Maggie, emotionally cold, is forced to put family dissension to one side and take up arms as a Western heroine, and Wood equally holds court with her transference from irksome waif to bold babe. Tommy Jones enjoys himself as he finds a cowboy role to suit his craggy features, features that impressively dovetail with Salvatore's stark photography of the landscapes. Along with the plucky and endearing young Jenna Boyd's performance it obviously only really mounts up to a broken family coming together under duress. But as a quartet, and with Schweig's vile turn as the \"monster\" of the piece in amongst them, they function so well, thus all character arcs are acted skilfully and please the senses. Also to be applauded is the use of genuine Apache language from some of the actors, a nice touch that shows a director taking his material seriously.\r\n\r\nThere's a few endings available to view via DVD etc, but the one that Howard chose for its general release is the right one. It perhaps doesn't hold any great surprise, given the directors reputation and output thus far, but it works well in the context of the story and the period tone set throughout. A safe film, then, one that is very well made and tells its story efficiently in structure and verse. If only the script had dared to take a few more risks then this surely wouldn't have been the monetary flop it was. Still, give it a go and you may find as much to like as I did. 7/10"

Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.\r\n\r\nSome people love this movie while others think it\u2019s weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I\u2019m sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids\u2019 investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6\u20195\u201d Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"

The inclusion of big celebrities that kids won't recognize is a little odd, but the in your face 3-d stuff is irritating, and there were several forced scenes, and a conflicting message of competition vs cooperation.\r\n\r\nThere are really high points of the movie: the story line itself is actually pretty good, the robot battle detour was actually a fun way to set up a call back, and there is a really good, if short, twist that I wouldn't expect in a kid's movie.\r\n\r\nThe last act was a little too insane for me, but I'm thinks kids might like it."

This movie is extremely charming, and very well written and produced.  It is obvious that they knew they had a contentious concept and needed to create something that deals with it carefully and tastefully.\r\n\r\nAs an idea that, \"oh, they can't get away from each other!\" is funny short term, like if they were glued together on accident (\"Family Guy\"), but as the sadness of the reality sets in they try to compete with overly ridiculous scenarios that wouldn't happen in real life and try to swing the odd situations as beneficial.  As that becomes obviously untrue, the sadness of it sets back in and is doubled by the idea of being permanently stuck with someone so wildly different that you.\r\n\r\nIf you can look past reality, then there is a lot of good humor in here, and a really touching love story crossed with a story of ambition versus family.\r\n\r\nOther than funny, this movie feels like it tries to be too many things, but that comes from having two wildly different characters each pursuing their own stories.  There's just a lot of overhead.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of problems with the movie, but it's uniquely charming, and there just aren't many conjoined twin stories."

            "review": "***Big Dumb Blockbuster Monster Fun***\r\n\r\nAlthough writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's \"The Mummy,\" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel \"The Mummy Returns,\" a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and \"exciting\" things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's \"Van Helsing,\" although not as bad.\r\n\r\nTHE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.\r\n\r\nIt won't take long for the viewer to perceive that \"Van Helsing\" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like \u201cThe Vampire Happening\u201d (1971) or \"Young Frankenstein\u201d (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.\r\n\r\nThe film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with \"The Mummy Returns\" the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone who\u2019s not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein\u2019s monster) are all entertaining or effective.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, \"Van Helsing\" barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movie\u2019s also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than \"The Mummy Returns\" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

Actually \"From Justin to KellY\" (2003) is a fun musical/beach film in the manner of Elvis films and the 60's beach flicks. One look at the movie poster and it's obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing films of this ilk it's time to just kick back, turn off your brain and have a good time. On this level \"From Justin to Kelly\" works fabulously. It's pretty much just as good or better than any Elvis or beach movie you can think of. Filmed in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, the story deals with the romantic adventures of youths on Spring Break. Keeping with the traditions of the genre there's no raunch or moronic sex/bathroom humor; the film has an appealing innocence.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight is that there are more gorgeous bikini-clad babes per minute than most movies out there (dudes too, if you're a woman).\r\n\r\nTo be expected, the songs featured are all substance-less modern pop ditties ('modern' as in the early 2000s, which hasn't changed much today). I don't normally listen to this kind of music, but it fits the upbeat and fun vibe of the film.\r\n\r\nI'm hardly an American Idol aficionado but I admit that I did enjoy the show when I occasionally viewed it with my wife. And Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the two stars of the film, were two of the more likable \"idols.\". (I also confess to liking Katharine McPhee, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Kelly Pickler and Clay Aiken). (I'm just joking about Aiken, lol). To be expected, Kelly and Justin aren't the best actors but they're not bad either, particularly as the story proceeds; the quality of the acting certainly doesn't prevent you from enjoying the flick. They did a fine job all things considered.\r\n\r\nOne can't bring up American Idol without mentioning the ever-present Kimberly Caldwell (from the channel station). She's an undeniably good-looking woman but she tends to grate on the nerves. The reason I bring her up is, if you've ever secretly fantasized about seeing her chopped in half, be sure to check out the goofy gorefest \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End\" (2007) (I'd call it a horror film but it's way too silly and over-the-top to be horrifying). This film makes your fantasies come true, literally.\r\n\r\nThe DVD features the 81-minute fullscreen version of the film whereas as well as the 90-minute extended widescreen cut, which has a few extra dance numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you're in the mood for an innocent beach flick turn your brain off and enjoy!\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

            "review": "We can be as different as we wanna be, but you can't kill people!\r\n\r\nMonster is the bleak story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute and one of America's most notorious female serial killers. Based around facts of her life and death, the film primarily focuses on the last year of her freedom. Where after entering into a strange lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, Wuornos, fed up of being a abused by men, starts killing those calling on her services.\r\n\r\nSad and potent is Patty Jenkins' first full length directorial effort. Though perhaps a touch guilty of pandering to Wuornos' own self created \"monster\" image, the film none the less has the right blend of sympathy and revulsion to make it a fascinating, if uneasy, experience. Former model Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation to become Wuornos, so much so she's practically unrecognisable. Bulked up in weight and with beaten down make up withering her face, Theron goes on to give a towering performance as the troubled, on the edge killer. \r\n\r\nWithout any thrills or hints of histrionics, Theron is uncompromising throughout the picture. To garner empathy with such an abrasive character is quite a trick, then to switch to monstrosity with conviction seconds later? Well that's almost magical in itself. Theron is backed up well by Christina Ricci as Selby. Selby Wall, an immature young lady oblivious to the dark path she is walking down, is given a great portrayal from Ricci. In light of the powerhouse show from Theron, it's much credit to Ricci that she enhances the film with her own delicate characteristics. Helping to emphasise the strangeness of the union in the process.\r\n\r\nIt's a tough film for sure, and come the final credits one is left with a feeling of sympathy towards Wuornos and the life she lived. If that be right or wrong is of course up to the individual viewer. Or if that was even Jenkins' intention is probably up for debate. But Monster exists and survives as a bitter character study of a desperate woman, which through the medium of cinema, makes us the viewers privy to something very edgy indeed. 7.5/10"

            "review": "I, Robot (2004), holding it's own in the genre pantheon?\r\n\r\nI, Robot has a fan base that I'm glad to say has kept this film from drifting down into the depths of bad blockbuster sci-fi ratingville. I remember upon the film's release how so many people were wary of if Will Smith could carry the film? The concerns from Isaac Asimov's fans about a sacrilegious take on his legacy etc etc. Truth is is that I, Robot is an amalgamation of sci-fi ideas, from the suggestion of Asimov to the novel of the same name from Eando Binder, it's a mix that ultimately gives us a cop versus sci-fi conspiracy picture, that is sure as hell entertaining if taken on popcorn terms.\r\n\r\nHaving just watched this again for the first time in a year or so, I found that it still hits the mark to me as a real tidy genre piece with a solid heart beat to keep it thought provoking. A futuristic mystery is smartly realised by Alex Proyas' directing in the manner befitting the subject, and of course Will Smith handles the entertaining action lead role with much ease. However, the main triumph (outside of the story) is Alan Tudyk as our computer generated protagonist Sonny, the voice and humanist movements are brilliantly brought to life by him and it's a real pleasure to observe.\r\n\r\nGreat visuals (Oscar nominated), top story, kinetic action, better than average acting (though Bridget Moynahan struggles to convince as a boffin at times), and we get a perfect nights entertainment for someone looking for a rental that safely delivers what it says on the robotic shaped tin. 7.5/10"

            "review": "***The Passion of the Christ, I mean Superman***\r\n\r\nSuperman returns to Earth after five years trying to find out what happened to his homeworld. As Clark Kent he gets his job back at the Daily Planet newspaper, but finds out Lois Lane has moved on without him -- having a live-in fianc\u00e9 and a five-year-old child, not to mention winning a Pulitzer for her article \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" Meanwhile Lex Luthor and his henchmen discover Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steal some of the alien crystals. Luthor's mad scheme is to create a new continent, killing billions of people in the process.\r\n\r\nThe story is a superhero retelling of the Christ story:\r\n\r\n- Jor-el gives his only son to protect (save) humankind. \r\n- Superman repeatedly states that he's everywhere and will always be around (i.e. omnipresent). \r\n- Luthor and his henchmen's beating of Supes is reminiscent of Christ's beating before his crucifixion. \r\n- Superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from Luthor's new continent. \r\n- When superman \"dies\" above the atmosphere of Earth he is shown in a cross posture.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lois Lane is an obvious type of atheism. Although she once believed in and even loved Superman, she's now convinced the world doesn't really need him. She's obviously unhappy and bitter; she lacks the pizazz she had when she once believed.\r\n\r\nOf course, all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer's attention. This is especially vital when the picture runs 2 hours and 34 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe film definitely has an epic vibe to it, even more so than the first in the series. It seems more serious, i.e. less campy, especially where Luthor and his team are concerned. The film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality. Even though the whole Superman mythos is totally absurd, the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real. On top of all this there are numerous humorous bits, which are laugh-out-loud funny (watch out for the hilarious \"It's a bird,\" \"It's a plane\" piece).\r\n\r\nOther things worth commenting on:\r\n\r\n- Some complain that Kate Bosworth lacks charisma as Lois Lane, but this all fits into the bitter \"I no longer believe\" subplot. Bosworth is fine in the role. \r\n- Some complain about Superman's 5-year visit to Krypton. What's the problem? Part of my youth was spent in Minneapolis and I've gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity. Why wouldn't Superman feel the same way? Why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft? Because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of Kryptonite (radioactive pieces of his homeworld) which would severely weaken him, not to mention he gets his powers from the Earth's sun. \r\n- Some complain about Lois' fianc\u00e9 and her son, the latter of whom may or may not be the offspring of Supes. Wouldn't it be natural for Lois to move on after about two years waiting? Her \"shacking up\" before marriage can be attributed to her new \"I no longer believe\" mentality. \r\n- Love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the Christ story. Superman loves Lois and vice versa, even though Lois is initially in denial. Love gives life and saves from death. \r\n- I liked the fact that Lois' fianc\u00e9, Richard (Marsden), isn't made out to be a villain. Interestingly, Lois picked a man who, as a pilot, could fly her around like Supes, albeit less spectacularly. I also like the fact that the film shows Lois being faithful to Richard even though she discovers she still loves Superman. The human heart is capable of loving more than one person, but can only be faithful or committed to one, if you know what I mean. \r\n- Frank Langella is his usual charismatic self as Perry White. \r\n- Kevin Spacey is excellent as Luthor and arguably superior to Hackman; this is especially evident as the story progresses. His larger-than-life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for Supe's main foe. \r\n- There are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story; there's obviously no rush to get to the next CGI action scene. Those with ADD beware. Needless to say, this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects. \r\n- \"Superman Returns\" was one of the most expensive films ever made at $209 million but made most of it back in North America ($200 million) while almost doubling it worldwide ($392 million). What's strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers, claiming it should have made $500 million.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: I was surprised to discover how good \"Superman Returns\" is. This is an epic and moving superhero film; sci-fi/fantasy at its best. Is it as good or better than the best superhero films? Not only is it as good, it's deeper.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

I then watched it. I've watched it before. I'll probably even watch it again. BOOM! This probably means nothing to anyone who's reading this (there's also probably nobody reading this) but regardless, it's quite a big deal.\r\n\r\nManaging to take something as mundane as one day in a repetitive dead-end catering job, and make it even vaguely humorous is rather an achievement. You should watch it and play the other-other \"The Game\" (sidenote: I lost the game) like we used to in High School. 'Cause I'm classy like that.\r\n\r\nSeriously though, and I can't believe my thoughts even as I'm typing this, but I honestly think Waiting... is an underrated American Comedy gem, maybe I'm just seeing that comparatively, or with the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, but I really do enjoy the film.\r\n\r\n76%\r\n\r\n-Gimly"

The makers never quite grasp the concept of keeping the mystery aspects of the plot still cloaked in scary tints. Tech credits are dandy, though an impressive cast list are not asked to stretch themselves. \r\n\r\nIt's not ever overtly frightening and lacks suspense in some key areas, but there's still enough of a creepy vibe here to not waste the time of first time viewers. Repeat viewing prospects, though? Unlikely. 6/10"

It marks the beginning of a passionate affair, during which Kabir is told that Sonia's husband neglects her. But Sonia cannot leave him because she cannot support herself without her husband's money. Sonia suggests murder and Kabir, blind with lust, agrees.
