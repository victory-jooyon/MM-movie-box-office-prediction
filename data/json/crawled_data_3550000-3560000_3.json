I went to the user review area of IMDB just to see if I was missing something or if others thought this good looking, atmospheric, well acted two hour slog sucked as well.  To my relief I found I was not alone.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a case of style over substance.  There is really nothing to \"hang your hat on\" with regards to what is happening to the family featured.  When the reveals start coming they are either obvious or trite.  The ending is complete crap, especially after the two hour journey to get to it.\r\n\r\nThe scariest scene happens early on and is not in any way supernatural.  After, we just go on and on and round and round and can only assume the mother is mentally ill.  That she is imagining everything that is \"odd\" or causing it herself.  When that proves not to be the situation, the denouement we are given is, again, craptastic and straight out of any run of the mill Z grade made for VOD horror movie plot.\r\n\r\nThis has been compared to \"The Exorcist\" but do not let that fool you.  This is no \"Exorcist\" or even anything close.\r\n\r\nAt best this is a film about a family dealing with mental illness.  Only not!"

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nOnce again, I didn\u2019t know anything going into the theater regarding this movie. In fact, Ready or Not wasn\u2019t even on my watchlist until the beginning of this week. I thought it was just going to be a passable and cheap horror flick, but the tremendously positive feedback from everyone around the world convinced me to give it a go. Fortunately, I wasn\u2019t disappointed! Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett deliver a dumb yet entertaining film with a childish yet fun concept never really explored in the gruesome and bloody way they do.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s one of those movies which the only flaw they might have has to do with the viewer\u2019s expectations. You\u2019ll only dislike this story if you don\u2019t accept its lighthearted tone. If you go in expecting a film filled with truly terrifying and scary sequences, you won\u2019t get that. If you go in expecting a movie with a dark vibe and tonally heavy scenes, you won\u2019t get that. It\u2019s one of the most common issues that audiences have all over the world: unrealistic expectations. After watching the trailers, it\u2019s clear that Ready or Not was always marketed as a horror-comedy with more emphasis on the dumb fun that the concept inevitably provides, so don\u2019t expect something the producers didn\u2019t even think of doing.\r\n\r\nHaving that in mind, the film definitely delivers what it promises. It\u2019s a fast-paced hide-and-seek game, filled with suspenseful scenes and genuinely funny moments. Its short runtime doesn\u2019t really let us care about every character, but to be fair, it\u2019s not like it truly matters in this case. Samara Weaving plays the bride who has to hide while the rest of the family tries to find her. Overall, everyone gives good performances, but Weaving completely steals the show with fantastic reactions to different situations, always making space for an extra laugh.\r\n\r\nDespite the unique exploration of a strange premise, it has a pretty generic and even formulaic development, which is a bit of a letdown. Granted, the ending is, well, unexpected in the way that it is executed, but its final result is still very predictable. There\u2019s a lot of cheesy moments, some do work, but others aren\u2019t near as effective. The score is actually one of the surprises since it\u2019s not usual for this feature to have such an impact in a rather simple movie. It provides a few chuckles with some witty lyrics, and it helps with elevating the suspense in the more tense sequences. It\u2019s also mostly well-shot and set in one-location, something I always deeply appreciate. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Ready or Not accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a fun and entertaining 90-minute hide-and-seek game like we\u2019ve never seen before. Its R rating lets its makers do whatever they please with the amount of blood and goriness present in a scene, which ultimately culminates in a jaw-dropping, hilarious ending. Samara Weaving is brilliant as the main character, carrying the whole film on her shoulders. Is it cliche? Yes. Is it formulaic and predictable? Yes. Is it cheesy? Hell, yes. However, this movie never intended to be a groundbreaking achievement in the genre. It just wants to deliver good fun. And it does.\r\n\r\nRating: B-"
