            "review": "Some diehard **Star Trek** fans may not necessarily feel that the Justin Lin-directed third installment of this science fiction/space saga film franchise \u201cboldly goes where no man has gone before\u201d creatively. Surprisingly, Lin (director of two \u201cFast & Furious\u201d flicks) shows some engaging and intriguing heft in **Star Trek Beyond** as the adventurous exploits of the USS Enterprise crew are likely to stir the collective pot where the nostalgic sentiments of the Star Trek brand from yesteryear bridges the gap to the current cinematic explosiveness of modern-day Captain Kirk and company. Although it is extremely difficult to immediately dismiss filmmaker J.J. Abrams\u2019s resourceful fingerprints concerning the imaginative **Star Trek** (2009) and the thoroughly enjoyable **Star Trek Into Darkness** (2013) he graciously steps aside to allow Lin\u2019s energizing directorial vision to further explore Trek mythology on the big screen.\r\n\r\nEssentially, **Star Trek Beyond** is a vibrant cosmic canvas that is expansive in its boundaries of exploration. Visually arresting, well-paced and armed with compelling story-telling and a healthy dosage of curiosity and mystery, Lin manages to stay true to the traditional Trek-oriented universe by incorporating rousing special effects and offering a galactic grandeur of planetary peculiarities and exotic alien races to stimulate the exquisite narrative. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (Star Trek\u2019s on-screen character Montgomery \u201cScotty\u201d Scott) incorporate an eye-opening mixture of dramatic edginess, off-the-cuff humor and the cohesive rapport among the cast-mates that have inherited the iconic Star Trek personalities and made these familiar faces from the classic 60\u2019s TV show and previous non-reboot films a revelation in the millennium age of blockbuster sci-fi action adventure.\r\n\r\nThe plot channels in a sense of challenging malaise for the USS Enterprise\u2019s top officers in Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). What seemingly spices things up regarding the deja vu space journeys aboard the spacecraft is the questionable and powerful device that Kirk and his crew are babysitting. This powerful tool of destruction is capable of destroying humanity as we know it. In particular, the opportunistic Krall (Idris Elba) is the lizard-looking culprit determined to get his diabolical hands on the corrosive contraption. Naturally, Krall and his menacing minions must subdue Kirk and his crew to achieve success in having this ominous object in his deadly grasp. Krall\u2019s willingness to cripple the USS Enterprise proved to be an ambitious mission fully accomplished. For Kirk and his group the results were disheartening as Krall\u2019s forceful attacks rendered the ship disabled as it crashed on the desolate planet of Altamid. Thus, Kirk and his charges are stranded on his rocky haven with no hope in sight. The harsh reality for the vulnerable USS Enterprise visitors, besides being divided and scattered in all directions on this problematic planet, involved getting into survival mode as the hostile reptilian creatures surrounded them at will.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned split of Kirk and his exposed cohorts called for a series of various crisis carried on at different, chaotic spots. Kirk and Russian crew member Pavel Chekov (played by the late Anton Yelchin) were primarily tasked with trying to rescue their colleagues from the claws of Krall and his cronies. Elsewhere, Dr. Bones (Keith Urban) tries to patch up the injured Spock following the aftermath of the ship\u2019s wrecking. Pegg\u2019s Scotty and womanly warrior in alien Jayla (Sofia Boutella) make the valiant effort in trying to reach Kirk in the middle of total ribaldry.\r\n\r\n**Star Trek Beyond** has stylized flash and Lin ensures that his pulsating production stays faithful to the Trek legacy. Sure, **Beyond** is not anything innovative or wildly distinctive in comparison to the other earlier entries but it still thrives where it counts in the spectacle of space-aged escapism. The cast is solid as the players\u2013Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin as well as Zoe Saldana\u2019s Uhura and John Cho\u2019s Sulu\u2013all demonstrate a suspenseful unity on screen and give the audience an indescribable excitement in this latest chapter that far from disappoints. Elba\u2019s Krall is robustly villainous in physicality and attitude and the alien race featured are interestingly hypnotic in creepiness. Lin, in the same vein as Abrams, is not shy about gift-wrapping his **Star Trek** edition in boisterous, sweeping helpings of scope and whimsy.\r\n\r\nOverall, this kinetic outing of **Beyond** practically guarantees that the rebooted **Star Trek** phenomenon will not be experiencing its final frontier any time soon.\r\n\r\n**Star Trek Beyond** (2016)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Idris Elba, Sofia Boutella\r\n\r\nDirected by: Justin Lin\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Space and Fantasy Saga/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016)"

Yeah, it was Viola Davis, who snatched the most prestigious award for her supporting actress role. Originally the film based on the stage play of the same name. It is a drama takes place in the 50s about a hard working family man, Troy. His past was not very good, which makes him a little arrogant when it comes to raining his boy. Marrying Rose was the best ever thing happened in his life. Though it was not a perfect family. The differences between them is what later bring twist and turns in the tale before heading for the final of the final act.\r\n\r\nA very simple drama on the fine topic. Most of the film was just a conversation or arguments. And most of the film was little slow moving with the very long overall runtime. If you can manage that, you can enjoy it. If you are a drama genre fan, then you will be more than happy for giving it a try. One of the best drama films of the year, yet not the greatest. It's all finger points at the performances. Those magnificent actors displayed magnificent show. Nearly 35 years old screenplay and 70 years old timeline, still looked the same and powerful. Despite the film's success and poured praises, I don't think it is for everyone. Definitely young generations won't enjoy it. It is mainly for families.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film avoids the usual clich\u00e9. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

He did this earlier with films like Ghilli, Pokkiri and Thuppakki, and does it now with Jilla. This time, he shares the glory with Mohanlal, who plays his godfather in the film. The plot revolves around Sivan (Mohanlal), a don in Madurai, who brings up Sakthi (Vijay), whose father died for him, as his own son. The two are a formidable force in the city but circumstances force Sivan to ask Sakthi to become a cop. But when an accident results in the death of several innocents, Sakthi wants his father to turn over a new leaf. But the older man is not in the mood to heed his advice, and soon, the two are on opposing sides. \r\n\r\nAs far as commercial films are concerned, Jilla is definitely assured filmmaking. Neason understands that the conflict between Sivan and Sakthi is what powers his film and sets up the initial clash between these two characters very well. Sakthi's realizes the error of his ways after a horrible blast, which happens because of Sivan's decision. The scenes following this blast are quite horrific for this kind of film but they are so effective in making us understand why someone as loyal as Sakthi will shift sides and decides to take on the person who is his father figure. The confrontation scene is very well shot and the dialogues too are punchy in this scene. Vijay and Mohanlal are very good here. Vijay utters Sakthi's lines in a nonchalant way (Unakkaga enaku pidikadha khakhi potu police aanen illa, enakkaga nee ippo nallavana maaru) while Mohanlal treats Sivan's lines with seriousness, and so we get to see where each character stands \u2014 the son only wants his father to change but the latter will not give an inch from his position and is even ready to banish him from the house. When the intermission point arrives, we eagerly anticipate what might come next. \r\n\r\nNeason also keeps Sivan's character in the grey area \u2014 he never has any remorse for the blast, he even brokers for a pharma company which is banned everywhere in the world; he is so egoistic that he wants to put Sakthi in place at any cost. Which is why, we feel cheated when the director decides to bring in another antagonist who wants to bring down the father-son duo. Thankfully, our disappointment doesn't last long as this character poses a formidable challenge to Sakthi and that keeps this segment engaging. He even has a minor victory when he manages to kill a character close to Sakthi and Sivan. \r\n\r\nThe lighter portions too are done with confidence. Neason understands the irony of a guy who hates the khakhi falling in love with a woman who is a cop, and treats the romance in a playful manner. He even approaches the scene in which Sivan urges Sakthi to become a cop in a similar vein. A godfather asking his son to do something he hates is heavy duty drama material but the director sidesteps this by going for a good-humoured tone, and just to not make it appear too frivolous, makes Sakthi tell his mom that he will do anything to not see his dad tearing up again. He also manages to get away with the implausible scenario of a don's hireling becoming a cop. \r\n\r\nThe main issue with Jilla is that it is overlong. Neason, probably in an effort to make it a wholesome entertainer, keeps packing in scenes oblivious to the running time. So, we have an unwarranted sub-plot involving Sakthi's sister and forcefully fitted songs which only make the film lengthy. Also, his tendency to cut to a childhood moment every time he wants to make an emotional statement becomes gratuitous after a point \u2014 the film itself begins with Sakthi as a boy; when Sakthi is injured, he recalls a moment when Sivan rushed to him when he injured himself as a boy; when his brother talks about growing up holding Sakthi's hands, he cuts to a montage of two boys holding hands."

            "review": "> A complete action pack, with not so popular actors.\r\n\r\nThis is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.\r\n\r\nThe money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.\r\n\r\nThe other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.\r\n\r\n6/10"

Because when the first movie came I thought it was a nice idea and then its sequel was so bad without any further innovative ideas to add up. I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.\r\n\r\nBen Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason. Don't expect high, because it won't serve you.\r\n\r\n5/10"

            "review": "Locke precariously drives down the road of crushing solitude. Concrete. A highly versatile construction material that harnesses strength and durability as aspects of its properties. Impact and fire resistant. A common element for brutalist architecture. And just like the eponymous construction foreman, all it takes is for one mistake. The most minuscule of errors, before an erected building collapses. Unable to withstand the misjudgement of its foundations. Locke, as he drives his tissue-littered BMW X5 from Birmingham to London, must confront unintentional accidents that have caused his mentality to inadvertently spiral out of control.\r\n\r\nA one night stand with Colman as she gives birth to a miscalculated oversight. Consequently causing Locke to abruptly depart for the hospital, resulting in his job dismissal and a construction company spending millions more on a building that has yet to come to fruition. Confronting his own family, showcasing honesty in the most desperate of situations. An hour and a half drive (\u201cas fast as the traffic will allow\u201d). Thirty six phone calls. A life dissolving in the confinement\u2019s of one location. He had everything. Security. Family. Shelter. Only for them to be removed by signalled communications in the luxury of his BMW.\r\n\r\nKnight illustrates the power of simplicity. No flashy visualised distractions. No abrupt editing mechanics. No action. The thrills, tension and drama stem from a screenplay that has its extremities tested by consistently filming in real-time. Allowing the dialogue to be the only aspect at the forefront. We witness an individual deal with the stresses of life. Both professional and personal. Examining the moralities of a man who strives to differ from his irresponsible father. But his wife\u2019s rebuttal is an opaque sentiment that challenges forgiveness. \u201cThe difference between never and once is the difference between good and bad\u201d. An eternally resonant message that self-drives this car journey into the realms of virtuosity.\r\n\r\nKnight\u2019s purposeful choice of enhancing the claustrophobic environment complements the depiction of Locke\u2019s world, as he knows it, swirling in on him. Reducing the boundaries of his breathing space. His stress and anxiety heightening with each phone call he receives. However, none of the above would\u2019ve been as effective if it wasn\u2019t for Hardy\u2019s exceptionally tantalising performance. Far from a car crash, he manages to centralise the focus on him with the camera rarely moving away from his bloodshot eyes or fatigued face. His desperation and intrusive responses illustrates loneliness on a more empathetic wavelength.\r\n\r\nDespite the act of adultery, you never view Locke as an antagonistic entity. He does his best to find \u201cthe next practical step\u201d whilst retaining the thoughts of the recipients in his own head. It\u2019s relatable, personally, on a level that cancels out the background noise. And that, is a powerful dramatic endeavour.\r\n\r\nThere are a few bumps on the motorway though. The various scenes where Locke talks to himself, as if he\u2019s talking to his father, were somewhat cumbersome techniques in order to convey his opposing stance to his father that still haunts him. It\u2019s not particularly subtle, and contrasts heavily with the dramatic phone calls. A desperate attempt to convey abandonment, which would\u2019ve been alleviated by a simple phone chat instead. It\u2019s not shot in one take, and so editor Wright embeds scenes of traffic and the bright luminescence of roads to segregate the narrative flow. These occur too frequently and conceives an occasional irregular pace. And the maternity nurse wasn\u2019t particularly helpful by constantly spluttering \u201cshe\u2019s afraid\u201d whilst Locke clearly stated he was on his way. Give the man a break!\r\n\r\nDespite these bumps, Locke is a smooth drive with dramatic heft and cinematic experimentalism. An irony of a construction worker having his life demolished in minutes. Testing an individual\u2019s moralities through a variety of stress-inducing situations, culminating into an illustration on solidarity. Hardy confidently drives the plot to its desired destination, \u201cspeed limits\u201d included."

            "review": "No doubt that actress Melissa McCarthy has become a pop cultural phenomenon within the last few years. She has hit the jackpot in a career gone on a whirlwind upswing. McCarthy has just ended a six-year run from her Emmy-winning turn on the popular CBS sitcom **Mike and Molly**. She was Oscar-nominated for her performance in **Bridesmaids**. She has made a slew of hit-and-miss comedies. Her hosting stints on the legendary **Saturday Night Live** are riotous. McCarthy is part of the much-talked about upcoming female version of the wildly treasured 80's cult classic comedy **Ghostbusters**. Additionally, ardent fanatics of the 2000-2007 WB network TV series **Gilmore Girls** recently rejoiced when McCarthy agreed to join the Netflix revival show that previously endeared her to television audience years before. So yes...to say that Melissa McCarthy is on a continued roll with her ubiquitous presence in TV and movies is an understatement.\r\n\r\nIn McCarthy's latest broad comedy **The Boss** she and her husband Ben Falcone (\"Bridesmaids\") collaborate as they--along with Steve Mallory--co-wrote the script with Falcone taking over the directorial duties. In fact, both McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the 2014 vehicle **Tammy** starring McCarthy with Falcone in the director's chair as well. So it is a relief to see how this Hollywood couple bond creatively over their film projects. However, it is not all that encouraging that the Falcones have subsided over generic laughfests. \r\n\r\nOn the surface **The Boss** could be perceived as a wacky female empowerment romp but dig deeper and this lackluster comedy has all the one-note comical deepness of a frizzled Phyllis Diller wig. McCarthy plays the brash and blistery Michelle Darnell, a Martha Stewart-esque CEO financial wizard with a convincing pretty penny that makes up her unbelievable fortune. In fact, Michelle happens to be the 47th wealthiest woman in America. Unfortunately, the law caught up with Michelle so now she is behind bars for inside trading.\r\n\r\nAfter months of doing \"hard time\" (in reality \"soft time\" for the jailed demanding diva), Michelle is released where she learns of her frozen assets and diminutive ex-lover and rival entrepreneur Renault (Peter Dinklage) who has taken over her multi-million dollar companies. With nowhere to turn for support Michelle decides to intrude on her long-suffering former personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). The tolerant Claire is a single mother to 10-year old Rachel (Ella Anderson). As one can imagine the insufferable Michelle is a terror in poor Claire's household with her bossy demeanor. Apparently Claire's nastiness is just not reserved for Claire as she has plenty of scorn to go around for the ones who dare to step in her way.\r\n\r\nSoon, Michelle discovers a way to get back into the capitalism game and recapture her status as a wealth-driven Wonder Woman. The agenda involves Rachel's Dandelion troop as inspiration for Michelle scheming to recruit the outcast girls from the Dandelions (dubbed \"Darnell's Darlings) to sell the exceptional brownies based upon Claire's crafty recipe. Naturally, Michelle is hard on the little gals to push her need for reaching success but in her own caring way she wants to educate the Darlings to become strong, independent future businesswomen armed with potential power and poise. With Michelle's sad-sack backstory as a rejected little girl raised in a Catholic orphanage where many foster homes denied her existence it is clear that the seemingly cold and calculating Michelle does not want her hardship to be repeated in the group of girls she is grooming for the kill of conquering the business world.   \r\n\r\n**The Boss** has some slapstick moments that are passable and the always game McCarthy is willing to do what it takes to sell the zany goods to ensure the hefty chuckles. Playing hard-nose harlots such as the coarse Michelle Darnell is McCarthy's specialty and she is effective when the material supports her tyrannical pushiness. However, **The Boss** feels lackluster because McCarthy's sketchy bits are slight and the movie's basic follow-the-dots lunacy is never on par with McCarthy's bombastic business-minded bulldog. The movie feels cheaply lifted from the hybrid boundaries of 1989's **Troop Beverly Hills** paired with 1988's **Big Business.**\r\n\r\nThankfully, **The Boss** is not as tepid or forgettable as McCarthy's other outings such as the aforementioned **Tammy** or **Identity Theft**. On the flip side, this toothless romp will never rub shoulders with the more acceptable McCarthy staples in **Bridesmaids**, **The Heat** or **Spy** either. In short, this particular **Boss** ought to be demoted to the unemployment line.\r\n\r\n**The Boss** (2016)\r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n99 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage, Ella Anderson, Kathy Bates, Tyler Labine\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ben Falcone\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng"

            "review": "A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nAnyone who is fortunate enough to share their life with a companion animal will undoubtedly get a kick out of the latest Illumination animated effort, \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets.\u201d The film soars when it focuses on animals interacting with their human guardians, with the canine and feline characters acting like real pets do (if my cats could talk, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d converse in  similar dialogue as portrayed onscreen). The first part of the movie is incredibly perceptive and clever, as is the last 10 minutes because it zeroes in on these very relationships (the opening and closing scenes of the movie are touching and have lots of heart). The problem comes in the middle when the story stops being about \u2018pets being pets.\u2019 Sadly, the majority of the film lags when it ventures into the dreaded animated movie territory of sheer stupidity.\r\n\r\nLoveable human Katie (Ellie Kemper) and her pup Max (Louis C.K.) are the best of friends. Max has several animal buddies that live in the same New York City high rise, including dogs, cats, birds and guinea pigs that stop by for daily visits. When Katie brings home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) from the animal shelter, Max devises a plan to get rid of him. Problem is, the two dogs find themselves lost in the big city and Max\u2019s would-be girlfriend Gidget (Jenny Slate) takes it upon herself to recruit other pets \u2014 including the elderly paralyzed basset hound Pops (Dana Carvey) and lonely falcon Tiberius (Albert Brooks) \u2014 to bring Max home. Along the way they find themselves at odds with the anarchist gang of \u201cflushed pets,\u201d a group of outspoken, anti-human animals led by former magician\u2019s bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart).\r\n\r\nThe voice acting runs the gamut from phenomenally good (Slate) to wince inducing (Hart). Slate is perfectly cast as Gidget, a poufy white spoiled little dog who eventually saves the day. She proves herself tenfold as a legitimate voiceover actor, and I hope to see her get more work in animation in the future. There\u2019s no denying that Hart is a super likeable actor, but his portrayal of Snowball the bunny is nothing more than repeated, strained yelling. His overall performance felt so labored and unnatural that listening to him onscreen actually made me uncomfortable. I will not hesitate to nominate Hart for a Razzie award for worst actor of the year because his voice work is that bad.\r\n\r\nIn the \u2018oh no, not again\u2019 category, there\u2019s plenty of dopey, brainless scenarios crammed in with a feeling that their sole existence is to appease young kids. We get yet another ridiculous animal driving a car stunt that we had to endure in this summer\u2019s nearly insufferable \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d In fact, in \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d we get not only a rabbit driving a van but also a lizard driving a bus and a pig driving a taxi.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity isn\u2019t the only problem: it\u2019s the repetition. The filmmakers must\u2019ve run out of good ideas and instead of moving the story forward, the audience gets the same monotony over and over and over again. I don\u2019t require my animated films to be completely based in reality (there\u2019s a particularly amusing Busby Berkeley inspired musical sequence in a sausage factory), but I do expect more originality than is delivered in this movie. The story at times takes a cynical approach in several places and some of the themes may be too much for sensitive kids (but the film provides a great starting point for a learning opportunity about pets and how animals shouldn\u2019t be viewed as disposable).\r\n\r\nAt least the animation is commendable, nice and colorful with lively, fully realized backgrounds. It\u2019s visually interesting enough for adults and fans of the genre but it\u2019s also vibrant and bustling enough to keep the kids interested. There\u2019s a lovely original score with a lighthearted, almost vintage sound. For me, the original music in this film is one of the standout elements.\r\n\r\nOverall I feel like this film takes a great idea and almost completely wastes the opportunity. This dull, unremarkable action caper is mostly moronic, but the imaginative peek behind the door at an animal\u2019s life when the humans are away is what\u2019s pure gold. I really wish the film had focused on that component. \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d is fine, but isn\u2019t destined for greatness.  \r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**"

So this tale is about an explosion at a Chinese nuclear plant and followed by the investigation conducted by the US and Chinese collaboration, the cops hire a convicted hacker to fast up the process and to nab the culprit who was behind the power plant disaster. These people begin their hunting by tracking the clues to the different locations and where they finally land and how it all come end told in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nI felt it was a too much realistic presentation. Like a documentary film quality, but full suspense filled story that stretched to over two hours. So sometimes it was very boring, because slowing down in any big development. At a time, some of the important scenes accomplished so fast like most of the action sequences. It mainly revolved around hacking plot, but was not that intelligent, so can be understood by everyone.\r\n\r\nInitially I disliked those circuit board graphics, which I thought was a good detail, but too much for a film like this and it never looked so convincing. The film was average, but I anticipated lot better than that. I liked the actors though. Whether it was Chris Hemsworth or the Chinese counterparts, all were decent according to what the tale required. The film is not for everybody, particularly if you don't like slow narration, you should not consider it to watch. But the film is not bad for once viewing.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

            "review": "Sometimes you gotta sacrifice a single sheep to save the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Salvation is directed by Kristian Levring and Levring co-writes the screenplay with Anders Thomas Jensen. It stars Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Cantona, Mikael Persbrandt, Jonathan Pryce and Douglas Henshall. Music is by Kasper Winding and cinematography by Jens Schlosser.\r\n\r\n1871 and ex-patriot Danish soldier Jon Jensen (Mikkelsen) is, after 7 years of foundation building, welcoming his wife and son to a new life in America. But after they all board a stagecoach bound for their homestead, events will see that journey not be completed. And thus begins a tale of retribution and redemption. \r\n\r\nThere are few smiles in The Salvation, in fact viewers will need to grab onto the sparse offerings of such very early in the piece. For it's a film of blood, brooding and misery, of intensity and a paucity of the good side of human nature. Levring has managed to successfully blend the traditions of the American Western with the feel of the Euro Spaghetti Oaters. There is so much for Western fans to enjoy here. It's a classic revenger pumped by a good versus bad heart, yet as pared down and as simple as the story may at first seem, there's interesting asides of worth. \r\n\r\nThe issue of Euro immigrants trying to make it in the Wild West is noteworthy, while there's a delicious juxtaposition between two soldiers from different continents, and different wars. Jensen fought the Germans in Europe, while his nemesis, Henry Delarue (Morgan), has been through the Indian wars. A most interesting comparison, one where the characterisations are vividly opposed to each other. Add in a good old town in the grip of a tyrant theme, and a bit of carnal desires upon thine brother's spouse, and it's a spicy hot pot.\r\n\r\nFilmed at dusty South African locations, there's a scenic beauty surrounding the harsh story. Westerns don't have to be filmed in America to look authentic, and this is a case in point. The town of Black Creek has been called fake looking in some quarters, not so. This is a new up-coming town, it's meant to be wooden and sparse. Hell! The saloon is also the local store, the mayor is also the undertaker, this is a basic Wild West town without frills and fancy.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the costuming is splendid, especially Morgan who is nicely dapper in black hat and crimson mack, and there's a whole host of face fuzz on show, which is needed to keep up the whole mud and blood, hard West factor. Levring has an eye for a nice shot, such as a full moon bearing witness, even a traditional slow-mo piece. All that said, irks do exist, Green's character is sketchily drawn, but she's playing a heaving bosom mute (her tongue was cut out by the pesky Indians), so scope for development is admittedly limited. While Winding's score is a bit too modern sounding for the key shoot-out sequences.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's great to see the Western is still thriving in this day and age of CGI and blockbuster pandering. From the shattering and moody first quarter to the bloody and excellently staged finale, The Salvation keeps the Western genre well and truly alive. 9/10"

Perhaps I was noticing it more due to viewing with subtitles, but there's a lot of moments where we see Sandra (Cotillard) retrace the same steps with each individual - it gets repetitive.\r\n\r\nCotillard, though, is top notch. She brings so much emotion and realness with her, nailing every single scene to deserve notable props. Away from the Parisian, there aren't any others to note; they are all fine but I would've loved a more meaty cast.\r\n\r\nI'd be rating it a level lower if it wasn't for the lead, who is easily the best thing to come out of <em>'Two Days, One Night'</em>."

            "review": "In filmmaker Scott Derrickson\u2019s original \u2018Sinister\u2019, this writer\u2019s critical impressions toward the sub-par psychological yarn was rather blunt if not consistent with the steady diet of formulaic fightfests. The following passage pretty much sums up the cinematic sentiments from the movie\u2019s critique:\r\n\r\n'At best Sinister is a lukewarm twitchy tale that routinely teases the audience with the obligatory guessing game of whether or not the conjured up evil-minded spookiness is imagined\u2026cheapened scare tactics, an ambiguous monstrous myth, transparent characterizations and a mixed bag of a supernatural storyline barely put any Sinister thoughts in our heads worth contemplating.\u2018\r\n\r\nWell, say what you will about the first \u2018Sinister\u2019 outing but it at least had some slight star power in lead Ethan Hawke whose presence was one of the minor pluses in Derrickson\u2019s shoddy shocker. In director Ciaran Foy\u2019s (\u2018The Citadel\u2019) tingling yet generic \u2018Sinister II\u2019, we hardly experience the essence of top-notch horror-induced hedonism. Feverishly flat, the creepily clich\u00e9d \u2018Sinister II\u2019 continues the tedious tradition of assembling sure-fire goose bump moments yet never really fortifying these mentioned moments with any heft of genuine suspense or titillating intelligence. At best, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 skillfully demonstrates its somber shell but horror movies in general, at least ones that strive for sophistication and coherence, should not continuously hide behind the sketchy synthetics of macabre mediocrity.\r\n\r\n'Sinister II\u2019 dutifully shares its symbolic connection with its predecessor. For starters, \u2018Sinister\u2019 alum James Ransone (the deputy from the first film) returns to the perverse playground while being blessed with a lead role in this frightful follow-up. After his dubious dealings with the Oswalt family in the first film\u2019 where he was part of the police force\u2019 the former law enforcer now works as a private investigator in his continued quest to combat that pesky spirit known as the demon Baghuul. Ransone\u2019s ex-deputy is consumed with the shocking murders that took place previously, so it is his mission to eradicate the further Baghuul-instigated mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe newest family involved in the menacing mix consists of an Indiana farmhouse containing a mother named Courtney Collins (Shannyn Sossamon) and her two young sons (real-life brothers Dartanain Sloan and Robert Sloan). Unfortunately, Courtney is battling back and forth with her insufferable and indignant husband (Lea Coco) as her poor boys are caught up in the heated drama. The last thing that Courtney needs is a domestic distraction in the farmhouse that incorporates the spookiness of the Baghuul\u2019s mischievousness. Thus, the hapless deputy-turned-PI must do what it takes to prevent the Baghuul from corrupting the psyches of this vulnerable family unit.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s screenplay, written by Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, plays up to its predictable strengths as the audience is already steeped in the \u2018Sinister\u2019 mindset. Unfortunately, the element of mystery and intrigue is already compromised because \u2018Sinister II\u2019 does not really leave much second guessing for its titillating tension since it already displayed the same kind of copycat gloom-and-doom blueprint as evidenced in the first installment. In echoing the familiar patterns of eerie scare tactics, this sequel merely mirrors the shady shenanigans found in the first showing that was not that innovative the original time around. Sure, the unsettling imagery does have some warranted punch that leaves somewhat of a horrific impact. The grainy and gruesome home film angle showing a family\u2019s hanging is undoubtedly quite affecting but the shock factor is brief and oddly forgettable. One is left wondering if there are enough tingly tricks up Foy\u2019s desperate sleeve to arm \u2018Sinister II\u2019 with more than just drab shadows and twitchy innuendo.\r\n\r\nIndeed, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 is atmospheric and bleak and does a sure fire job of creating a dank and disturbing universe where the percolating peril steadily brims. However, that is the problem with \u2018Sinister II\u2019 as it settles for the surface-base hedonistic haunting without committing to anything morbidly motivating sans the convoluted creepy conventions. Ransone\u2019s bid to expose the imposing beast Baghuul while protecting the fragile welfare of the vulnerable Collins is genuinely a number-by-number plotline that feels stillborn. Even the dastardly Baghuul is stripped of anything particularly mysterious or diabolical for the audience to get on board and become mortified. Resembling a late gray-bluish sandpaper-faced rocker in The Doors\u2019 frontman Jim Morrison with long stringy hair and mod attire, the Baghuul does nothing to really stimulate the gory imagination of \u2018Sinister\u2019s movie-making mythology\r\n\r\nLittle beauty and the rock n' roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER. \r\nLittle beauty and the rock n\u2019 roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER.\r\nIn the long run, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 sings a spooky song in many ways but arms its tepid tune with the continued cheap thrills and false jump edits that are so annoyingly common in contemporary creepfests. \u2018Sinister\u2019s crime is not so much the calculating presence of a haunt hipster looking to stunt the growth of bewildered housing inhabitants as it is following the pedestrian path of boofests with banal bangs of exhilaration.\r\n\r\nSinister II (2015)\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr  30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Dartanain Sloan, Robert Sloan and Lea Coco\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ciaran Foy\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Psychological Thriller/Supernatural & Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * * stars (out of 4 stars)"

But someone clarified that it was not made outside the novel to make money. It's indeed adapted from the sequel book of the original film's source. Though coming out 20 years later was the disadvantage. Except some praises it had received, particularly by its hardcore fans, it was average at the box office and I thought same as well.\r\n\r\nI did not like the story. It was just a random drag, not knowing what direction to head. That's until the third act, and once all the three main characters come together, so it gets interesting with something. Like surviving from from a revenge threat. It was the actors who saved the film. Otherwise, it is not even an average as I consider now. I don't think retaining the title was a good idea, but I think it was just for its fans. Or else, a new title name would have done a decent justice to what it had narrated.\r\n\r\nAs I know, this is the director's first ever sequel and he's not getting better since his Oscar win, a decade ago. Especially the last two flicks, despite based on the very good subjects. Definitely no to the T3. Instead, I want another Oscar nod film from him. This would have been ever worse if somebody else would have made it. Yet, a watchable film, only if you had liked the first. So just think about it before going for it after seeing only positive words from a few people.\r\n\r\n_5/10_"

There were somethings that they got right, and others that dragged on.\r\n\r\nI thought \"Be Our Guest\" was done beautifully. The 3d made it even more enchanting. The main characters' backstories also added some depth to them. However, there were some scenes that I felt added nothing to the story. Such as the search for Belle by Gaston and her father. The \"No one is like Gaston\" scene didn't have the bravado or arrogance of the original.\r\n\r\nI also felt that Luke Evans was miscast. He wasn't the handsomest guy in town, nor was he the strongest. Which is why it was hard for me to accept him as the character. Emma Watson was serviceable. Her voice was fine, but it wasn't strong enough to carry Belle's songs. Dan Stevens was the best part of the film. I felt that he should have had more songs, because he has a beautiful baritone. Although his beast costume should have been more frightening. \r\n\r\nOverall, it's a fun film to watch. Though, I wouldn't call it a classic."

And the feeling of being stuck and unable to escape the situation, is accurately described in the  psychological struggle of the veterans.\r\n\r\nTrauma rips you out of your safe reality, where you have grown up with dreams, goals, and appreciation of the small good things in life. Every one of these things has been destroyed in a blink of an eye for these soldiers. \r\nNow their life is put in a pause-mode, where they relieve the trauma feeling over and over and over again. And it eats them away, until they realize they has to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThe fight is not direct as in war, but they now have to fight for their sanity in a society that stigmatizes PTSD. \r\nTheir commanding officer belittles PTSD and the soldiers that had committed suicide. The healthcare is scarce or completely absent. And the bureaucracy makes it almost impossible to get help. This happens all the while their mental health is deteriorating and their family life is falling apart...\r\nNo wonder a lot of veterans give into suicide!\r\n\r\nTrauma is grim, horrifying and leaves you more scattered than ever. It is a state of confusion, helplessness and horror. \r\n\r\nMost people will experience trauma and PTSD during their lives, not just veterans. But many, comfort themselves with the thought that it wont happen to them. The effect of trauma is very difficult to understand, and therefore difficult to treat.  Therefore it is of utter importance that films like these are still being made, and stories like these is told, until we get better to understand, treat and comfort everyone that experience trauma. Even yourself."

To his daughter, Grace, who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales... until she meets Pete, a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliott. And from Pete's descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham's stories. With the help of Natalie, an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon.",

            "review": "The infectiously whimsy and adventurous **Pete\u2019s Dragon** undergoes a polished millennial-style rebirth for today\u2019s kiddies not fortunate enough to be alive when the 1977 live-action animated musical blueprint made its charming, impressionable impact for youngsters of all ages back in the day. The festive and frolicking Disney flourishes are applied to co-writer/director David Lowery\u2019s re-imagination of an impish boy and his devoted dragon. There is an even balance of refreshing nostalgia and modern-day spryness and magical sentiment that hovers over this engaging family fable remake from the polyester period. Lowery (2013\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t Them Bodies Saints\u201d) and screenwriters Toby Halbrooks and Malcolm Marmorstein pack some vibrant punch of wonderment into this children\u2019s tale of gentle mischievousness. Sure, the simplistic approach to the storytelling feels like a step-by-step progression experienced in a majority of child-friendly escapist entertainment. Still, **Pete\u2019s Dragon** is steady in its gentle precision for homespun high jinks. \r\n\r\nWhether appreciating this Disney classic from four decades ago or relishing in Lowery\u2019s current contemplative spectacle one will agree that the heart and soul of this sweet and uplifting narrative remains true to the main factors involved: the runaway (now orphaned) boy Pete and his trusty creature companion Elliot. In fact, it is just as instrumental that the adult presence in **Pete\u2019s Dragon** make an impacting impression as well because this exposition should cater to the delicate sensibilities in us all whether as a curious tyke or reflective grown-up.\r\n\r\nOrphaned and alone, 10-year old Pete (Oakes Fegley) had become a wild child in the deep woods. What was looking pretty grim for Pete in terms of loneliness, abandonment and despair was soon cured when he ended up befriending a giant green furry high-flying dragon named Elliot. For the most part the imposing Elliot served as Pete\u2019s surrogate parent while ensuring protection and friendship for the parent-less prepubescent. There is no question about the dependency that Pete and his dragon Elliot share in loving dependency. The scenic wooded haven serves as the treasured playground for the playful, nature-loving tandem.\r\n\r\nEnter the father-daughter duo of Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) and Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard). Both strangely have an eerie connection to Pete\u2019s and Elliot\u2019s existence without realizing it. Meacham had been telling engagingly colorful stories to the local children about a mysterious dragon existing in the Northwest Pacific woods. As for Grace she happens to be employed as a Park Ranger for the site of the mentioned woods her father constantly references in his repetitive stories. Soon Grace will encounter the disheveled Pete who is more than willing to share his adventures of living in the thick woods with his massive dragon buddy Elliot. This all seems rather intriguing to Grace because Pete\u2019s description of Elliot is curiously similar to the fictional monster that Meacham cites to the spellbound youngsters. Whatever the case may be regarding Pete and his personalized plight this is something that Grace must investigate.\r\n\r\nGrace is not the only one who finds the wandering Jungle Book youthful clone intriguing. Both Grace\u2019s fiance Jack (Wes Bentley) and 11-year old Natalie (Oona Laurence from \u201cSouthpaw\u201d) are in awe of Pete as well. In any event, Grace and Natalie are determined to find out what lies beneath the surface with the boy and his behemoth sidekick dragon that recalls Meacham\u2019s exaggerated tall tales.\r\n\r\n**Pete\u2019s Dragon** dutifully follows what amounts to be the on-going formula for escapist children\u2019s storybook gems as recently told on the big screen. The reliable source of pathos and warmth wisdom stems from a vulnerable child in search of belonging especially when trying to locate, recognize, reunite or reminisce about the absence of parents. Thankfully, **Pete\u2019s Dragon** is in formidable company with animated treasures such as _Finding Dory_, _The BFG_, _Stranger Things_ and even the aforementioned _Jungle Book_ that follows such a playbook. The realism behind the idyllic childhood is having that sturdy foundation of family and support especially in the impressionable stages of youthful innocence. Among other things Pete\u2019s Dragon solidifies the magnitude of growing pains and a sense of isolation and quieted despair. This is an important message although embedded in the confines of an innocuous juvenile fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe young Fegley resourcefully carries the breezy heartfelt material on his capable little shoulders as the enchanting Pete. The adorable Laurence is equally effective as Natalie whose bonding with her imaginative partner-in-crime Pete is admirable. Elliot the dragon is nothing more than an overgrown affable beast that would make for an amusing act at a neighborhood children\u2019s birthday party. Both Redford\u2019s Meacham and Howard\u2019s Grace are essential as the older elements bridging the mysteries surrounding the mischievous moptop and his humongous hairball confidante.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to critically slay **Pete\u2019s Dragon** as the thrills and life lessons in resiliency should prove instrumental for the enthusiastic kiddie crowd watching from the sidelines.\r\n\r\n**Pete\u2019s Dragon** (2016)\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Oakes Fegley, Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Oona Laurence, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban\r\n\r\nDirected by: David Lowery\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Children\u2019s Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng** (2016)"

It seems they never ever see the bright side in this business (making products). This is the Sino-US collaboration product and as usual the film was too poor. The animation was much better than some of the B animation features. But the universe was too small, or you can say restricted for certain enclosure makes it fall in as a bad film. That's when you observe the backgrounds, you would notice how substandard it is.\r\n\r\nVisually and basic storyline seems not much different from other animated flicks. Because it kind of reminded me many awesome films from the recent past like it either be ' Kung Fu Panda' or 'Zootopia'. All about chasing the impossible dream and an inspiring theme. But still I believe the little kids like under 6-7 might enjoy it. Yeah, this is definitely not for the grown ups like most of the modern animated films are. That's a sad part, yet some adult would find it better.\r\n\r\nThe film was built on the most common clich\u00e9d platform. A young Tibetan sheepdog is not interested in what his kind destined to do. Instead, he's very much into the musics and after inspired by what the famous musician said, he embarks a journey that would decide his fate. So how his life going to change comes with the remaining parts. There were some nice comedies, but nothing tried hard to uplift film. From the beginning itself, it was so familiar, which did not give any space for a better improvement in the later parts. An average film, maybe below that, yet watchable one. Short film though, with the nice music.\r\n\r\n_4/10_"

            "review": "Director Jake Szymanski\u2019s fictitious siblings Mike and Dave need more than wedding dates in this baseless and brainless raunchy comedy. For starters, it needs to wipe off its monotonous mediocrity as a lame laugher laced with empty-headed vulgarity and cheap chuckles straining for manufactured amusement. The genre regarding raunchy comedies had always had that miss-or-hit gamble about its cockeyed presentation. For the tedious and tepid **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** it is safe to say that it will not be on the Mount Rushmore of classic naughty farces in the tradition of _Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Porky\u2019s_ or the _American Pie_ film franchise anytime soon. \r\n\r\nBanally sluggish and lazily crass, **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** tries desperately to register its juvenile high-wire impishness as inspired lunacy but the profane randomness of Szymanski\u2019s (along with screenwriters Andrew Jay Coleman and Brendan O\u2019Brien) jiggle-and-giggle romp is about as riotous and inspired as a drippy diaper. Thankfully **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** does not entirely sink to the forgettable levels yet of say the earlier released fetid raunchfest Dirty Grandpa (although both films features principal players Zac Efron and Aubrey Plaza in the cast) but that still is not saying much for its feeble defense.\r\n\r\nThe problem with most modern youth-oriented sex farces is that ready-made mentality of delivering shock value debauchery that have no sense of coherence or irreverent purpose to support the so-called funny, bouncy rhythms of the movie is sloppily realized. Instead, filmmakers focus on promoting outrageous and recycled ribaldry without arming the unconventional story with something more serviceable and solid. Essentially Szymanski tosses the stilted zaniness against the wall hoping that anything sticks as proposed hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe Stangle Brothers in Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) is a couple of mischievous misfits that attract mayhem whenever possible. They revel in the sordid good times and are proven to be a handful for their exasperated parents Burt and Rosie (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy). The only ray of hope concerning Burt\u2019s and Rosie\u2019s success regarding offspring comes in the package of daughter Jeannie (Sugar Lyn Beard). Jeannie is preparing for her upcoming wedding and appears to have something concrete going on in her life more so than her \u201cparty-hearty\u201d bone-headed brothers.  \r\n\r\nAnyhow, Mike and Dave are subjected to the ultimatum set by their frustrated parents to \u201cstraighten up\u201d and grab some semblance of maturity. The source for getting this dim-witted duo to shape up involves their baby sister\u2019s Hawaiian-based wedding. If Mike and Dave were to attend Jeannie\u2019s exotic ceremony they must grab respectable dates otherwise reject the notion of becoming part of their sister\u2019s life-changing, special occasion. One of the puzzling aspects of this toothless plot is to ponder why these sibling screw-ups would seriously care to change their wayward ways by a parental threat of not showing up at their precious sister\u2019s island-based nuptials? Oh please\u2026\r\n\r\nIn any event, Mike and Dave get busy trying to fish for formidable escorts but this proves futile until an Internet ad seeking \u201cnice girls\u201d for a Hawaiian getaway draws considerable attention as loads of women take notice.  As the many female applicants react to Mike\u2019s and Dave\u2019s sensational date to the scenic 50th state for some gorgeous sun and fun there are two tarts in particular that pop out of nowhere in Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick  from \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d and Aubrey Plaza from the aforementioned \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d).\r\n\r\nAlthough they are stimulating as eye-candy for the brothers to drag to Hawaii both Alice and Tatiana fail the required prerequisite as being goodie two-shoes companions for Mike and Dave. In fact, Alice and Tatiana are quite the opposite but must hide their true nature as bombastic bimbos with acid tongues if they are to take advantage of the golden opportunity to travel to picturesque Hawaii. Predictably, the devious dates fall into their genuine selves as rambunctious chicks\u2026something that Mike and Dave must deal with concerning this clumsy deception by the riff raffish Alice and Tatiana.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** intended to be some throwaway chuckle-minded showcase searching for its titillating temperature of off-kilter jocularity. Sadly, this moronic movie is reduced to going through the run-of-the-mill tactics of broad jokes falling flat, lightweight sight gags, silly-minded pratfalls and attractive profanity-spewing undesirables that are somehow supposed to tickle our collective, indiscriminate funnybones. Consequently, everything in this callous concoction of a comedy feels relentlessly artificial, overwrought and forced. \r\n\r\nSure, the off-the-wall characterizations in the main foursome of the Stangle sibs and their tag-along traveling trophies are expected to be a fine hot-mess. Nevertheless, the whole production unintentionally strives to be that same hot-mess but for totally different reasons. Efron, a veteran of a string of painful cockeyed comedies that some of his most ardent female fans might have trouble recalling, channels his familiar wild pretty boy persona from Neighbors\u2026one of the very few flicks worth mentioning on Efron\u2019s flaccid filmography. Devine\u2019s Mike comes off as achingly overbearing as the brother with the showy awkwardness to match the synthetic obnoxiousness.  Kendrick\u2019s Alice does not seem remotely convincing as the phony \u201cdecent date for hire\u201d. At least Plaza\u2019s Tatiana shows some modicum of plausibility as the bad girl grounded in rawness.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** could not have added anything fresh or subversive to the trivial table with the noxious material and other regurgitated clich\u00e9s that bombard these notoriously flimsy R-rated spectacles with a pseudo-provocative pulse. It is safe to say that watching the eye-rolling shenanigans of Mike and Dave Spangle on the big screen is enough to call this whole exhausting affair beyond a dating disaster.\r\n\r\n**Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016)**\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr. 38 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Zac Efron, Adam Devine, Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza,Stephen Root, Stephanie Faracy, Sugar Lyn Beard \r\n\r\nDirected by: Jake Szymanski\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * \u00bd stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\nFrank Ochieng \u00a9 2016"

            "review": "> The day when the dogs stopped wagging their tails.\r\n\r\nThis movie was a tricky one, because everyone cannot understand and everyone cannot enjoy it. In this modern world, the computer graphics are easily available to illude the audience, so who would still use the silly old practical trickery in a film making. Must have been the hard work to manage plenty of the dogs during the shooting. But I believe there are hardly any major CGI works other than the bluescreen works. If you get the movie, then that's fine, if not, you may get some ideas through this review. Before proceeding I just want to alert the readers the review might contain some spoilers which is not measured.\r\n\r\nThe Hungary's entry for the last concluded Oscars. The movie talks about a girl Lili in her early teenage, aspiring musician and her mixed breed dog name Hagen. When a circumstance forces them apart, the individual life journey begins for both of them. The girl becomes rebellious towards her father and the dog towards the human society like a piece of iron bar pulled away from the magnet. Will they unite again? Is the rest of the story with the breathtaking second half.\r\n\r\nThis dark fantasy (like dark comedy) film was like the old days, like the black and white beast or the monster films similar to 'King Kong' and others, where animals can think like humans, execute like humans, but still not a fairytale nor the science fiction. Because sci-fi applies theoretical probabilities, animal psychology et cetera, while fairytale is a magic. It will come between sci-fi and fantasy, most likely an adult version of the fantasy tale. Comparing it with 'Birds' is one hundred per cent not agreeable, because unlike the dogs, the birds' behaviours were unknown. But 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' was the closest one, and you can compare Caesar with Hagen.\r\n\r\nIt does not end there, I believe you all have seen the last year's genuinely written screenplay 'Lucy'. You may wonder why this comparison, because this film is about dogs, yet the title strangely pronounced as 'God'. What I understood was that Hagen was drugged with cocaine (white powder) like the blue powder in the other film and he started to change his personality. So that explains the coke was the 'White God' and the rest follows the story of revenge, leadership and ultimately the revolution.\r\n\r\n> \"It's hard to lose someone you love.\r\n> Things don't work out the way we imagined.\"\r\n\r\nOff the record: Most of us know that the dogs are derived from the wolves. Yet they have lost the freedom compared to a few centuries ago who walked freely on the human streets. Every dog must have a master/owner or it will be put to sleep rather keeping and feeding them forever in the dog pound. So I think dogs are suffering more than the apes and they deserved the revolution (according to this film).\r\n\r\nAnimal abuse was highlighted in the movie. The story was descended from there and what happens if they takeover us is the movie's view. One of the weirdest movie of the year, but different and good. If you ever had a dog, you will know they were adorable, even in the violent scenes. Because they were just playing, but that does not the case for children and those who never been with dogs. Every shot that had dogs were cleverly achieved, the outcome was very convincing.\r\n\r\nI have heard the crew used two brothers for the Hagen role. They both were awesome, equals to any main human characters from the movie. Another 250 mixed-breed stray dogs were participated in the film making and later most of them were adopted. Believe me the movie was a good one, but some people had a hard time accepting the oddity of the theme. It won a couple of awards at Cannes film festival, including one for the Hagen's character performance.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian film industry to make into the international level, they should take the cue from this success and must bring the sequel with a broader cast. Nowadays, experimental movies like this are welcomed by the moviegoers around the globe. Definitely, an interesting story with the striking scenes and dialogues would make everyone turn toward the eastern Europe. Obviously I recommend this one, but never expect the style of Hollywood, it had approached its own way to give a pleasing movie.\r\n\r\n8/10"

Maybe that's because I went to a nice theatre (which I haven't done in a while) and saw it with a couple of close friends on a very nice day, but I rather think that it's primarily because of Jeremy Renner's character. The way he's written, acted, and shot, are all pretty much flawless. Off the strength of him alone, I could probably send you out to see _Tag_, but there is a Hell of a lot else to appreciate about it too.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"

            "review": "A popular PlayStation-era game is the frivolous foundation for the kiddie sci-fi action-oriented animation adventure **\u2018Ratchet & Clank\u2019** that makes it a playful stamp on the big screen. This kid-friendly space saga, armed with its beloved reputation in the world of gamer groupies, could be deemed as the junior-sized \u2018Star Wars\u2019 for the minor sect. Why would the mini movie-goers not find this big screen adaptation an appealing space-aged actioner worth its weight in innocuous, escapist gold? After all, what is not to like about the roguish and heroic feline-looking creature Ratchet (otherwise known as a \u2018lombax\u2019) with the Buck Rogers attire as well as the cute clanking companion in the green-eyed, robotic Clank (channeling the impish and lovable R2D2 from that certain George Lucas-directed worldwide cinematic sensation from yesteryear?).\r\n\r\nOur galactic good guys look to save the universe and the avid youngish video game fanatics will eat this fun-loving fantasy up with moon dust soup. Unfortunately, **\u2018Ratchet & Clank\u2019** musters up a tepid by-the-numbers frenzy that will predictably hold the munchkins\u2019 imaginative attention. As for others, the hyper hairball and his trusty tin can tag-along get lost in the shuffle of this somewhat serviceable but sluggish cartoon pie-in-the-sky popcorn pleaser for the little ones at large.\r\n\r\nDirectors Kevin Monroe\u2019s and Jerrica Cleland\u2019s spotty spunk captures the loose lunacy and spirited sauciness on occasion where even the movie\u2019s poster promises to \u2018kick some asteroid\u2019. It is too bad that the breezily bland storytelling cannot overcome its conventional confines as one may get a more stimulating kick engaging in the actual video game than viewing this kinetic crater kiddie showcase without much distinction or creative plucking pop. Basically, **\u2018Ratchet & Clank\u2019** is safe and generic but never grabs the challenging aspects behind its one-note presentation in good versus evil\u2013something that may in fact be a clich\u00e9d overload even for those tykes out there begging for these amiable planetary protectors to bring something fresh outside of its gaming inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe youthful mechanic Ratchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor who also provided the voicing duties in the video game) is a dreamer with heroic plans to join the prestigious glory-seeking Galactic Rangers. Specifically, the Galactic Rangers are known for their courageous crime-fighting activities on Ratchet\u2019s home planet. Ratchet\u2019s lofty ambition to hook up with the Galactic Rangers is somewhat alarming to his boss and mentor Grimroth (John Goodman) who is not too thrilled with his employee\u2019s/protege\u2019s questionable expectations. The Galactic Rangers are currently recruiting for skilled members to collaborate with them and expand the elite unit. For the star-eyed Ratchet this is a golden opportunity to become a starry-eyed superhero reaching for acceptance and self-importance.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, a treacherous tyrant known as Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti) is the galaxy\u2019s menacing madman and one of the main reasons why the Galactic Rangers are nursing the thoughts of growing their interstellar roster of crime-stoppers. Drek is out of control as he has been destroying planets left and right. Naturally, the dastardly Drek needs to be stopped in his hideous mission to castrate and conquer. Drek\u2019s calculating cronies include his second-in-command robot Victor (Sylvester Stallone) and ominous scientific aide Dr. Nefarious (Armin Shimerman from TV\u2019s \u201cStar Trek Deep Space Nine\u201d). They are instrumental in creating killer robots whose sole purpose is out to eradicate the celebrated do-gooder Galactic Rangers. Of course this begs the question: does Ratchet really know what he is getting into regarding his heralded aspirations to become a Galactic Ranger?\r\n\r\nIt would take a pint-sized turncoat from Drek\u2019s robotic renegades in the form of defective and rejected Clank (voiced by David Kaye) to escape the mechanical baddies and whisper the devious goings-on to the noble Galactic Rangers. The initial meeting of Ratchet and the British-sounding Clank is incidental but when they thwart the sneak attack initiated by Drek\u2019s tin-plated terrorists the pair are invited into the applauded team\u2019s inner circle courtesy of the tandem\u2019s rescuing efforts. Galactic Ranger head honcho Captain Quark (Jim Ward) has his doubts about the eager talented twosome but the other members embrace Ratchet and Clank with open arms. Still, the common goal is to eliminate Drek and his horrible henchmen Dr. Nefarious and Victor from orchestrating the ruination of their jeopardized universe.\r\n\r\nAlthough showing some spunk and off-balance wittiness,   **Ratchet & Clank** feels notoriously recycled as it obviously borrows from other animated fodder while tapping into the all-too-familiar Star Wars mantra that features a young adventurer from a distant planet thriving to save the galaxy from sinister forces. There are colorful action sequences and gun-toting shenanigans that will entertain the impish kiddies as they engage in the elaborate space battles. Both leading lads Ratchet and especially the merry-minded, metal-plated Clank will come off as an adorable yet oddball duo to behold. The villainy of Drek and his devious drones will probably spark the giddiness in the wide-eyed youngsters. The common sense behind Ratchet & Clank is to arm the movie\u2019s presentation with the feel and feisty-oriented flavor of its video game blueprint. If that is the case then why bother serving up a family fantasy on the big screen if it cannot separate occasionally from its vintage gamer blueprint?\r\n\r\nCuriously, the fast-paced hit-and-miss jokes and the spry-looking makeup of this kid-approved cosmic caper is a passable revelation for a movie representing a fourteen-year old video game from yesteryear. Also, the notable names behind the characterizations in **Ratchet & Clank** seem to give some measure of breezy joy to their on-screen roles. Celebrity voices instilled in the fired-up female warriors consist of the likes of Rosario Dawson\u2019s Alaris and Bella Thorne\u2019s Cora which evoke the recent reminiscences of Star Wars: The Force Awakens\u2019 Daisy Ridley\u2019s heroine Rey. Consequently, all these factors mentioned in the rousing yet rudimentary Ratchet & Clank boils down to just another basic and tiresome \u201cgood-against-evil\u201d gimmick for the chorus of the kid-watching crowd.\r\n\r\nIt is a given that **Ratchet & Clank** will be a spell-binding spectacle to the young viewers but for the rest of us let\u2019s hope that a nostalgic rerun of Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space will suffice for our adequate needs blocking out the fire-power crafty cat and his diminutive autotron sidekick.\r\n\r\n**Ratchet & Clank (2016)**\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr. 34 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring (the voices of): James Arnold Taylor, David Kaye, John Goodman, Sylvester Stallone, Paul Giamatti, Rosario Dawson, Bella Thorne, Jim Ward, Armin Shimerman, Vincent Tong\r\n\r\nDirected by: Kevin Munroe and Jerrica Cleland\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Space Fantasy/Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Animation\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**"

I don't think Ice Cube's solo performance could have pulled the crowd in, the impact was because of the Kevin Hart's presence, he really rocks. He's doing some awesome movies lately, and he's the best sidekick and comedian available for now in Hollywood, just like Simon Pegg in England.\r\n\r\nOnce again a movie is totally underrated, especially by foul mouthed film critics. Trust me, this film is much better than what they say. If you liked the first, you'll surely going to enjoy it as well. I'm confident the rating will recover in the later days once the regular people rent it. A simple follow-up story, but it was the comedy that lifted this film. The two cops soon-to-be bros-in-law goes to Miami on a job, but the case they're working connects with others, so they join the local force to take down the gang behind it.\r\n\r\nWho needs a spoof film for it, the movie mocks its own characters by saying 'a low budget Jackie Chan' for Keng Jeong. Apart from the comedies, the action sequences were very impressive. Olivia Munn was a great addition and I believe she would hangouts here for the next. Yep, I want the third movie and I'm hoping it to be even more stylish kick-ass action-comedy. So just retain the director and writers, after the first two films, I got high hope on them.\r\n\r\n7/10"

It became one of my favorite movie & below are reasons why: First, it's original, different from other horror movies, which brings interesting story, where crowd of few people seek historic relic & treasure. Movie was very eerie & creepy, especially when they go deeper & deeper close to hell. Some very strong & intense moments. Atmosphere was also eerie cause whole movie happens in damn catacombs. If you have Claustrophobia I don't recommend to watch it. If you're fan of movies like The Tunnel(2011) or The Devil's pass, you gonna like it."

            "review": "**Survival of the Batsh!t Craziest**\r\n\r\nHere we have a sociopath for the digital age. A _Taxi Driver_ for the early 21st Century. Louis Bloom might have been born yesterday, just before taking an online course in Small Business Management, the new way to self-educate, without the petty annoyances of human contact and interaction. Every basic lesson he absorbed is put to the test with the obsessive solitary singular purpose of succeeding. Jake Gyllenhaal immerses himself in the role with psychotic stupor. He speaks with the same forward-plotting conviction whether tossing about obvious clich\u00e9s or revealing something brilliant. The perfect entrepreneur. A maniacal detached idiot savant on a ruthless predatory mission. Morality and the legal system are minor roadblocks to dodge, riddles to resolve, sentiments to overcome. His brand of narcissistic psychosis is a genetic mutation that insures the survival of the species. Like an Aryan bulldozer, he cripples and kills the weak, exploiting the flaws in humanity, cannibalizing the limits of civilization, and capitalizing on each opportunity every step of the way, all for his own personal gain. All while intuiting which backs to scratch and/or stab and when. The perfect entrepreneur. The quintessential post-9/11 movie hero. Where Travis Bickle sought to take down corruption to rescue the innocent, Louis Bloom does the opposite, preying on the fallen and severing the social codes and mores that bind us for his own solitary success. American Exceptionalism. Nightcrawler is nanoeconomics in its purest, most wicked and vicious form. I'm sure some may see it not so much as a comment on what ails us but as an inspiration to venture out from, and Bloom as a persistent determined role model to imitate. How-to-Succeed-in Business-Without-Feeling. Humanity is merely a construct that can be subjugated, an apparatus to dismantle, a child's toy for the child that wants it all."

            "review": "> Losing that you love makes you realise its value.\r\n\r\nThe only reason to I go to Nick is to watch 'Shaun the Sheep'. This show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. As the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. I was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. Its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, Shaun. The promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous Hollywood films like 'Boyhood', 'Wild', 'Birdman' and many others.\r\n\r\nStop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. Every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. The technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. Still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. It made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no CGI. So when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. Every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.\r\n\r\nIt was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. The filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. Had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. Because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. Shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. The journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. They go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.\r\n\r\nUnlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. There are some emotions involved, and I was amazed by those exhibitions. Because of some kind of childhood connection between Shaun and Co and their owner. That was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. We know Shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. So when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.\r\n\r\nAs usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. A true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. Almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. And for the fans its a celebration time for sure. Definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) Oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. But for winning, we have to wait till how good 'The Good Dinosaur' going to be. In the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd/10"

I don't recall seeing a darker Indian movie. When the movie ended, I felt UGLYNESS in my soul. That's not supposed to be a good thing, but I imagine that was the purpose. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around a 10 year old girl who goes missing. Her biological father is a struggling actor, her mother is an alcoholic and her husband is a top cop. Then there's a guy whose the actor's friend and is a casting director. There are a few more notable characters. The central characters are trying to figure out the whereabouts of the girl, but they all have bones to pick with each other. Here the title comes into play. What's uglier than the supposed kidnapping of the girl is that they all have their vested interests and that they're more keen on satisfying those then actually finding the girl. The journey to the climax brings out the ugliness within these flawed characters. And it's not one for the faint hearted. \r\n\r\nAnurag Kashyap is my favorite Indian director of this day and age so I'm always a bit biased towards his movies but Ugly has got to be his finest work till date. The story isn't flawless, but the direction is. Mr Kashyap succeeds completely in bringing out the ugliness of his characters, who could easily be breathing and walking human beings amongst us, which makes it all the more chilling.\r\n\r\nThe acting by entire cast was superb. Each and every one of them brought their characters alive on screen. You could feel strongly for them, hate, sorrow, pity and a lot more. The screenplay and editing is tight, dialogs too good and natural. I felt there were 2-3 loopholes and if not for them, the actual story could've been perfect.\r\n\r\nAll in all a definite 9 out of 10 for me."

            "review": "> Emotional dispute for an innocent young soul.\r\n\r\nOne of the beautiful melodrama of the year. It is a partial courtroom drama and it was about a biracial kid, whose grandparents fight to own the custody. Obviously a sensitive matter, but incredibly written screenplay that balanced both the ways. Such kind of theme is always welcomed, but in this case, again, those critics behind ruining the movie. Should have been in the Oscar race in any category, but it didn't. The reason is simple, about famous people and histories always have the edge over the fictional works in the film world.\r\n\r\nChild custody battle is a most familiar theme, but not a very common. In this, the characters are so special, made a huge difference with an interesting opening plot. At some point I felt scenes were very intensified and old fashioned, but the story and dialogues were not. Lots of emotional scenes involved right from the first frame itself. Especially one of the courtroom scene in the third act which was a turning point in the story was so touching. The families are definitely going to love that particular part.\r\n\r\n> \"Well, there are certain things a man can do,\r\n> certain thing a woman can do.\"\r\n\r\nTop notch performances, especially the Kevin Costner, and Octavia Spencer in some crucial parts. Apart from them it has some cheerful humours. A movie that is not pinpointing the mistakes of the past like some of the recent films depicted, but looking forward to the future and unifying by removing fences. As a living creature, the conflict within is not an invalid, even non-living substances do have when they come together in the form of chemical reaction. So as we're civilised, it must be minimised. Happy or sad ending, it does not matter, because it is simply delivering a message about the difference between good and bad.\r\n\r\nThe kid was the centre of the story formation, but the screenplay did not designed her to dominate. Because her presence was the vital than to display stunning performance, as it was a conflict between two different racial people. But, how the kid gets affected if the confrontation gets ugly as the story progresses is the point to develop ahead. So that brings the climax, and you should watch the movie to know how it all ends. I would say it is a very underrated movie and needs immediate recognition. It will going to be one of those movies to be praised in the future.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd/10"

Some people claim that this movie do not follow the books but, obviously, I cannot comment on that. So my review is based on the movie and the movie alone. I have to confess that I mostly watched this movie because I did watch the first instalment and felt obliged to see where the story went.\r\n\r\nThis movie have quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube with the message to the inhabitants in the closed up city. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nAs with Divergent I found this movie to be fairly mediocre. One reviewer said that this was a movie dumbed down for the teenage audience. Unfortunately I feel that he was right. Also unfortunately I think many teenagers are a lot smarter than Hollywood believe they are.\r\n\r\nThe plot is, well, mediocre. The acting is fairly meh. The main character, Tris, really lacks any form of charisma and spends most of the movie going around in some state of melancholy feeling sorry for herself and everything that happens around her. Apart from Four most of the people were behaving immaturely, cluelessly, froze up or panicked whenever something nasty happened and switched allegiances back and forth like you changed shirts.\r\n\r\nWhen Tris finally opened the cube I was expecting something cool and unexpected. What we got was a rather dull message about the city and its \u201cpurpose\u201d. I complained in my review of divergent that we got absolutely no background information as to how the people had ended up in this ridiculous situation with a closed city and these factions that I still do not understand what they were supposed to solve. The message was supposed to explain this but it explained absolutely nothing except that the divergents were some kind of purpose or solution.\r\n\r\nThe ending? Well again this is a book series so it is not surprising that it ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger but it was really a cheap ending, one that you would expect from a TV series episode.\r\n\r\nSo I cannot say that I liked the movie very much. The virtual reality special effects scenes were fairly cool but that was about it."

            "review": "> When the man and the nature overlaps.\r\n\r\nA semi biographical adventure-drama from China directed by the French director known for 'Seven Years in Tibet'. He was chosen after many Chinese filmmakers refused to take the project, because of the dedication it required. The film highlighted the outcome of the two ethnic groups, Mongols and Hans overlapping with the mother nature. The film should have been one of the best in the line of 'Siberia Monamour', but there a few things that did not work in its favour.\r\n\r\nIt was just like the 'Embrace of the Serpent', based on a person who went to a distant place with a motive, but learnt another thing. Especially realsing the value of the native people and their land and culture. The main character was totally resembling to the Brad Pitt's role from 'Seven Years in Tibet' and very inspiring. You learn nothing by observing afar, you have to get in and get along to gain knowledge of the place. So you have to be one of them in order to see through their eyes of the place and then would find its true identity.\r\n\r\nThe tale begins in the late 60s during the China's cultural revolution. Two young students from Beijing sent to a remote place in the Inner Mongolia to teach the locals read and write. Instead, one of them gets interested in wolves and decides to study them by raising a cub. During that time, the confrontation between the wolves and for the human encroachment of their natural habitant determines the future of the grassland. The ultimate face-off between them ends with the emotional.\r\n\r\n> \"The problem for us Mongols is that our history wasn't written by us, but mostly by our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you don't belong to that place, you should not intervene in its natural order. The China's history is always bad when it comes to the land grabbing, either it is the ongoing South China Sea dispute or the Tibet and thousands of others. This is such a film made by China itself that spotlights their wrongdoings. Just see the film to know how much different the Mongolian, especially the nomad culture and the Han-Chinese. They' both saw the mother nature with different intentions. So imposing one land's rule to another does not work and that's the film's most important message.\r\n\r\nVery sad the film was not realistic since it was based on a real story. Visually it was very good, especially the locations were spellbinding and used so well to tell a story, but the animal behaviours were too silly, something like that happen in the children's stories. Then there's evidence the animals were harmed during making it, so feels uncomfortable in many scenes and I won't advise kids to watch it if they're very fond of the animals. In that angle this film got a completely a wrong motion picture rating. If you are a light hearted, you should as well turn away from it. Because even though they won't show the killings, in a few segment they were just graphics and make-up, but still you are definitely going to feel the pain, very disturbing film.\r\n\r\nIn a few scenes, feels bad for what Mongols regrets for letting the Hans to do all the terrible things to their land despite at one stage of the history they were more superior than them. At least the film ended on a positive note, only because of the alteration in the screenplay from the controversial book. It was originally selected to represent the previous Oscars, but soon it replaced with another to avoid the International humiliation. I think the film was not that terrible, but not being true to the book was the issue. It is very hard to suggest it, it might upset you for the various reasons, so all I can say is choose wisely.\r\n\r\n6/10"

The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.\r\n\r\nThe location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.\r\n\r\n8/10"

            "review": "This is very much my kind of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick\u2019s very emotional response to his wife\u2019s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with \u201cno emotional nonsense\u201d is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an \u201cordinary\u201d guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn\u2019t go into some silly \u201coh should I really pull the trigger\u201d trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys\u2026eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick\u2019s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it \u2026 so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or \u201cobligatory\u201d scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is \u201cthe bad guys will pay\u201d all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday."

The special effects were quite well done but could have been expanded a bit more. I gave it 3 1/2 stars."
