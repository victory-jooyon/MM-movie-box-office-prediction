The scripted segments were fine even though their talents are made for that sort of thing and the skits did have me rolling, though I am a fan. That said, of the 90-minute running time, I think about half the movie are the challenges. But if you're a fan of the show, it's fine for one viewing, but I'll stick with the episodes. **3.0/5**\r\n\r\nAs a side, the Blu-ray release has no bonus material and one would think there are deleted scenes or even some behind-the-scenes footage or something."
