Only on the characters, but the story was pretty much the same like about jealousness. The story of a middle aged woman and to begin the life again. Alice a daughter of a famous filmmaker, is not all happy in her life after the marriage is at in the risk of collapse. Then suddenly all changes when three youngsters she meets at the club. What follows after is to enlighten her life, but not everything's going to be fine. It could be more trouble than the solution she's hoping for, especially for a long term in mind. So what are those issues and how it resolved were told in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nFrom a new director. She wrote it as well. I've seen many women director's films in this year than any other. They are making revolution here. This is actually a decent film, but surely not a bad one as you have heard. Reese Witherspoon was awesome. She always good at such roles. So basically this film is for her to watch. But the three young actors too was not bad. The story was better, especially how it all ended. This is for the gown ups, above 25-30 years old people. Because of how everything revolved, only they can understand it better. And also for the open minded people, because it's about the modern moral thing like traditional sentiments in a relationship were removed to narrate this tale. So definitely a decent film to watch once in my opinion!\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

Nels is so unassuming that when he is awarded Citizen of the Year he states that there are others far more worthy and fusses over getting dressed up to accept the award and make a speech.\r\n\r\nWhen his son is found dead of a Heroin overdose; Nels is not willing to accept that his son was a user even though this puts tremendous strain on his marriage and has taken Nels to consider suicide. At his worst moment he learns that his son\u2019 co-worker was involved with some shady dealing and that his son was likely collateral damage from the criminal elements involved.\r\n\r\nWith a new found sense of purpose: Nels embarks on a quest to find the truth and avenge his son\u2019s death no matter the consequences.\r\n\r\nOne would think that \u201cCold Pursuit\u201d is a standard revenge film but it unexpectedly changes direction shortly after Nels starts exacting his revenge. The film transforms into a Dark Comedy of sorts as characters get a Title Screen when they are killed many of which have a morbid humor to them. The film even takes the bold step of moving away from Neeson for a good third of the film and putting the emphasis on other characters from rival crime organizations to the Sherriff and his eager Detective (Emmy Rossum).\r\nAs such the film is not what you expect as although there is plenty of action at times; it is a Dark Comedy with dramatic elements. It is more in line of what you might expect at a Film Festival from an Indie studio versus a major studio release.\r\nAs such fans of Neeson may be disappointed in seeing a departure from the type of films they have come to expect from him in recent years while others may embrace the quirky nature of the film.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5"

I can't be certain though, because I'd have to re-watch them all to make sure I'm not making a bad recommendation, and I'm not super keen on doing that seeing as this one and the one preceding it were both kinda... bad.\r\n\r\nThe mythology of _Insidious_ is something I am very interested in, and _The Last Key_ added it to it **somewhat**. But if this is the sort of quality we can expect from future instalments, then maybe we should never see the resolution of the same cliffhanger ending that they've given us for **the last three movies in a row**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

            "review": "Alongside _Weekend_ and _Moonlight_, _Call Me By Your Name_ is the greatest queer film I have seen in the past ten years. It's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - Luca Guadagnino has given us something truly special here. I'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. The fact that the legendary James Ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.\r\n\r\nThere are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).\r\n\r\nOh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls. Chalamet does the same thing here and it's overwhelmingly stunning."

No. But it's indeed his best since Punch-Drunk Love, which continues to be the pinnacle of his talent.\r\n\r\nWhile the film isn't the best talking about technique, it seems to me that its style is totally focused on making the experience an exhausting one. And Uncut Gems is an overwhelming journey full of anxiety and stress. It achieved that splendidly.\r\nThat's its greatest accomplishment: To immerse you in the entire atmosphere of the environment that Sandler's character inhabits, while we witness the cascade of bad decisions he makes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest mistake is how the directors get to over-lengthen the story, which indirectly gets to a point where Sandler's character becomes obnoxious but I think that's part of the experience, because who ever in their right mind would feel more sympathy for a person like him? I mean more than the allowed sympathy anyways.\r\n\r\nIts ending, although predictable is certainly what he built and there's no learning in it and it doesn't need to be.\r\nAfter all the story was his decline while he believed that he was going to succeed. And yes for a moment he did and for a moment he savored it, but as happens many times in life, good things aren't made to last.\r\n\r\nAnother triumph for A24.\r\n\r\n9 likes"

It stars Sverrir Gudnason, Shia LaBeouf, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Tuva Novotny. \r\n\r\nThe Swedish Bj\u00f6rn Borg (Gudnason) and the American John McEnroe (LaBeouf), the best tennis players in the world, maintain a legendary duel during the 1980 Wimbledon tournament.\r\n\r\nCut to the chase, this is one for tennis fans to gorge upon, but even then it's a bit too lop sided to fully delight. Being a Swedish production it's heavily loaded towards the personal worries that were plaguing Borg in the very early 1980s. Sadly this renders McEnroe - one of the games greatest and most colourful characters - as being a support player in what set out to be a biographical pic about sports rivalry. \r\n\r\nHowever, what does come across is that both men were driven and actually both were tits for varying reasons. There's unsurprisingly some parental pressures, while Borg feels the strain of breaking records (as his wife chain smokes) and McEnroe strives to get on the ladder to greatness. Sure the tennis sequences don't hold up to scrutiny but both Gudnason and LaBeouf (excellent and excellently cast) come out of the physicalities very well.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's a character study that doesn't delve too deeply for equal parties, but come the 1980 Wimbledon final, with one of the greatest 4th sets ever played, you should be hard pressed not to rejoice. Not only in the sport of tennis played to the max, but in how two supposed rivals actually became the best of friends. 7/10"

            "review": "With so many movies today about exorcisms, I was expecting just another copy of those movies, but on my surprise, this movie was different and well shot, quite scary. Atmosphere was good, makeup was done brilliant and almost everything in short was great, but there were few mistakes in some scenes that were too unrealistic and basically mistakes. For example: When Megan shows Lisa the footage of camera where corpse is clearly visible in the corridor, Lisa says that it's just a shadow? Seriously? Shadow of what? How in the center of something there can be shadow of nothing? And then Lisa notices the medicine Xanax and starts giving Megan a hard time and lectures about using Xanax completely ignoring the footage and fact that something unusual, some figure is spotted in the camera. This scene was very unrealistic and in real scenario any sane person would pay attention to that footage instead of stupid Xanax.\r\n\r\nSecond mistake was when Megan tells Randy about wound of corpse and Randy also recalls that corpse had a huge wound and now it's gone and instead of being shocked and curious how it happened guy starts talking about his past life that he had problems with drinking... I understand that horror genre is unrealistic itself, but those scenes were too much and lacked the common sense.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the opening scene, well while it didn't have such big mistakes as those two scenes, I think it wasn't necessary and it looked like typical those copy exorcist movies I mentioned at the start.\r\n\r\nIf movie didn't have those mistakes, I would give it 10."

But you sure as hell don\u2019t expect a doctor to, and yet, Sarah Sawyer can not only steal a gun pointed at her, she can stop a burning building\u2019s fire without even being in the building!\r\n\r\nWill Sawyer\u2019s posed with a challenge when the tablet that he was for some reason given with full control of the security system and just about everything else about the building, gets stolen, the building set on fire, and his family stuck above the fire with little means to get out.\r\n\r\nWill, who is now a suspect, takes it upon himself to enter the burning building, get his family, and leave the burning building. This isn\u2019t as easy as that sounds, because there\u2019s a MacGuffin to be gotten and the people that set the building on fire will stop at nothing to get it. Oh, and did I mention **he only has one leg!**\r\n\r\n_Minor spoilers ahead._\r\n\r\nSkyscraper was extremely predictable, the only thing I didn\u2019t see coming was the fact that they wasted five minutes of our time showing Will telling Sarah to turn off and back on her phone to fix it, just to set up the ending where Sarah turns off and back on the building to stop the fire.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I did enjoy from this film was near the ending when they\u2019re in _The Pearl_, but you don\u2019t watch a movie for a single scene.\r\n\r\nRawson Thurber should stick to comedy, where he has experience. This is a waste of the $125,000,000 it took to make it, and it\u2019s a waste of the $12 to watch it. Skip this one."

After spending 130 minutes totally immersed in the world of 1950s high fashion, I felt like an utter rube walking out of the cinema in my jeans and hoody combo.\r\n\r\nPhantom Thread is as immersive as cinema gets. From its opening sequence, which takes us inside the House of Woodcock, a London fashion house run in quietly tyrannical fashion by renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis), Anderson's film dismisses any thoughts we might have of our own world of 2018. As we witness Reynolds go about his daily grooming routine it becomes clear we're watching a movie about a perfectionist, one made by a perfectionist, and starring a perfectionist in what is reputedly his final acting role.\r\n\r\nSet in his ways like a tree set in concrete, Reynolds knows what he likes, and he likes what he knows. As such, his relationships with the many admiring members of the opposite sex (the film is set at a time when no man was more attractive than one who made things; and if those things happened to make women feel beautiful, like Reynolds' gowns, all the better) rarely get past the following morning's breakfast, where idle chit chat and toast buttering irritate him to a laughably over the top degree.\r\n\r\nIt's during breakfast away from home, in a small country caf\u00e9, that Reynolds meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a pretty Eastern European waitress who is won over by his flirtatious charm and accepts his invitation for a dinner date. The relationship blooms quickly and Reynolds invites her into his home, teaching her the ways of his trade.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take long for Alma's ways to begin annoying the fiercely independent and somewhat narcissistic Reynolds, and her presence begins to disrupt his work - she's become an anti-muse! Reynolds' assumption that she will follow the other women in his past and leave quietly once exposed to his spoilt brat boorishness couldn't be more wrong however. Alma is determined to make the relationship work, even if she has to take extreme measures.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of Eric Hillis's review at http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2018/01/new-release-review-phantom-thread.html"

Walter is essentially like if Flint and Sam had a baby but more obnoxious with his can't-shut-his-mouth, self-righteous attitude. There's even some elements in the story taken from cloudy like the whole invention goes wrong thing. I was expecting it to at least be average because characters barring Walter didn't seem bad but it turned out worse than I thought. The characters are two dimensional with predictable arcs and Walter had no flaws so no character development besides a predictable bonding with Lance. Even the pigeons are one-dimensional. It's one of the top 10 or 15 worst animated films of the decade even if it came out at the tail end. Avoid it, it's so overrated."
