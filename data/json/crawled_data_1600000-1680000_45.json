It was a big mistake. There should be no expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie all in all was okay. Just okay. It was 2 and a half hours. The clothes were awesome of course. But then sometimes I can't help but think, it's too awesome for the place you're in to be wearing it. My favorite part was the wedding. It was fun and so gay which was awesome. The plane and the hotel was amazing. There were several \"WOWs\" in the theater and I'm sure we're all thinking of the same thing: \"I wish I have a friend like Samantha\" or \"I wish I can also do that for free\". But then after a while, you can't help but  think: this is too much for this movie. It's like not sex and the city anymore. I mean they're not having sex (or they can't because they're in Abu Dabi) and they're not even in the city. The title should've been \"Sex and the City goes to Abu Dabi\" or \"Carrie and the Girls Goes to Middle East\". It doesn't make sense anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut I don't really mind watching it again. The clothes, the purses and especially the shoes are the only things that I love looking at in this movie."

She has made her entry into the village with a very definite purpose. All this, plus the very different kind of bonding between Gopalakrishna Pillai and his mother, form the plot, which develops towards a very interesting climax.",

Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus, for this he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors and the loss of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and woman never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen when they must train an army to become as ruthless and blood thirsty as their reputation has become.",

This is the reason I was not interested in this. Usually biopics are made to inspire the viewers, but there are negative films as well and this is one of those. Actually, it was not about the Saddam or his politics or his family, except Uday. So it was told from the perspective of Latif. How he suffered and fought back was the film focused on.\r\n\r\nAfter watching it so delay, I think I was wrong about it. The film is for adults, but the thing is it reveals lots of dark secrets of Uday's lifestyle. Sadly the film did not cover much of the Saddam Hussein's events. The Kiwi filmmaker did his best. Dominic Cooper's performance in the dual role was the highlight. That should be the reason to watch this, because you know like me, people are turning it away once they read whose story is this. This film is here to remind us the bad history about the bad people, other than that there's nothing in it.\r\n\r\n_6/10_"

            "review": "Oh, this is the stuff. How I\u2019ve missed great horror. American studios have, by and large, ignored producing truly great horror over mindless pablum like Final Destination 6, or Saw 23, or Nostalgic Horror Film Remake 117. Slashers, gore-fests, dead teenager movies and all the other imagination-barren dreck neglect that incredible power a great horror film can wield over its viewer: namely, that it\u2019s the only genre that can truly encompass every emotion, running the audience through the gamut so thoroughly that they\u2019re exhausted and fully satisfied at the end.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark is a great horror film. I\u2019d also rank it up there with the great fantasy films; dark fantasy, to be sure, as dark as it gets, but fantasy all the same. It\u2019s a faery tale, with the a-e spelling, replete with faeries, an evil stepmother, a princess and a castle.\r\n\r\nOh, and what a castle it is: the film takes place in the dark, dusty confines of the gloriously decaying Blackwood Manor, a house into which reasonable people would never dream of entering, much less owning. Luckily for us, this faery tale is populated by and large with unreasonable people, for reasonable people have no place in faery tales.\r\n\r\nLittle Sally Hirst is sent to live with her father in Blackwood Manor, as her mother doesn\u2019t want her anymore. Her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his live-in girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) are working on restoring the mansion to its former glory, it having been empty for the last hundred years. But Sally\u2019s arrival awakens\u2026things.\r\n\r\nLurking things.\r\n\r\nHungry things.\r\n\r\nLittle do Sally, Alex and Kim know the dark history of what happened to old Emerson Blackwood, and the secrets that the bolted-shut fireplace holds, or what has been unleashed at Blackwood Manor.\r\n\r\nThe tropes of the faery tales are both apparent and subverted here. Sally (Bailee Madison) is a withdrawn, sullen child, wise beyond her years and smart enough to know she\u2019s been abandoned. Alex is a father who loves his daughter, but doesn\u2019t know how to be a parent to her. Kim is a de facto stepmother who didn\u2019t ask for this child but does her best to provide Sally with warmth and love, particularly in lieu of Alex. Terrors are visited upon the girl, but only she knows they\u2019re real; after all, what parents truly believe there are monsters under their child\u2019s bed? Parents know that the monsters aren\u2019t real, even if they are. Children know the monsters are real, and no collection of assurances, no matter how lovingly given, offer enough protection.\r\n\r\nBailee Madison is the focus of the film, and she gives a terrific performace. She\u2019s a real little girl, not a falsely-spun Hollywood version of one. She is reckless, irresponsible, smart, sullen, and terrified. Katie Holmes shines as the stepmother who tries her hardest. Guy Pearce fares well, though he has the most thankless role as the Parent Who Doesn\u2019t Believe.\r\n\r\nOne of the great strengths of the film is how it uses that frustrating disbelief as one of its pillars. The creatures are eventually seen, in ever more apparent lighting, and what that removes from their eeriness it adds to their threat; we know, as does Sally, that these monsters are real, and without help, harm will come. It\u2019s an growing, inexorable conclusion that is terrifying in its mounting inevitability.\r\n\r\nThe entirety of the film is masterfully crafted: the acting is uniformly excellent, the atmosphere is thick and foreboding, the cinematography lush and gorgeous, the art direction is darkly enchanting and the sound design (particularly of the creatures) is terrifying. Even after the creatures have been revealed, their terror doesn\u2019t diminish, and I credit that not only to the sure hand of first-time director Troy Nixey but also the impeccable sound design.\r\n\r\nNixey, a former comic book artist, was hand-picked by producer and cowriter Guillermo del Toro after seeing Nixey\u2019s short film \u201cLatchkey\u2019s Lament.\u201d It was a perfect choice. Del Toro worked for decades on remaking this film, based on an ABC movie of the week from the 1970s starring Kim Darby. He said the film terrified him so much that it was the impetus for him to go into horror filmmaking. And del Toro\u2019s signature touches are all around, from the youthful heroine to the incorporation of faery tales to the trademark art design. None of that should dilute the appreciation for Nixey\u2019s work, however; it\u2019s so rare to find a director who takes time to build atmosphere and ratchet up tension to the breaking point rather than telegraph every scare and pull the trigger too soon.\r\n\r\nThe film is rated R, for there is no other rating to accommodate it. The filmmakers were attempting for a PG-13 film, which they thought they could accomplish without overt gore, language, or sex. When they submitted it for rating, the MPAA gave it an R for intensity, saying it was non-negotiable for \u201cpervasive scariness.\u201d Upon being asked what they could do to get a more commercially-viable PG-13, the MPAA responded \u201cWhy ruin a perfectly scary movie?\u201d\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark has what is so lacking in horror films today: imagination. Dark, terrifying, magnificent imagination. The kind that makes you glad you\u2019re able to sit there, in a darkened theater, and let it devour you whole."

The absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within Venom himself (between Brock and the Symbiote) and the movie would have been a lot worse if Tom Hardy wasn't capable of pulling that off. Look, a _Venom_ movie probably should have been rated R, and it probably should have taken more notes from current superhero movies than superhero movies from fifteen years ago, but I still had a good time with _Venom_, maybe it's not the best possible version of the story, but I'm still glad we have this one.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

The actors where great (there no Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen), Kevin Bacon played the baddie very well and was well suited for it and it was graphically impressive.\r\nLoved to see the development of the characters over the duration of the film.\r\nIn all, I think it was a excellent movie."

It started with a heist at a bank (obviously), done by two people in a clever and rather peaceful way (they start by locking up the nearby cops, so they can't come after them), but when I finally started to focus on the movie, I had completely lost the plot. The one minute these two were acting like friends, the next... they seem like they hate eachother.\r\n\r\nBut honestly, I dont think that it matters much. The plot is just an excuse in this movie, for two people to have some fun together. I mean, even though I had little knowledge of what was going on, I still had some fun watching the rest of it, more or less (I did get distracted a few times again). The two people are, of course, Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington. They are like children playing with their characters, just enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nImagine if the plot had been interesting and worthwhile, then maybe this could actually have been a great movie, or wait... maybe the plot was interesting and worthwhile, I just never realized it because I got distracted.\r\n\r\n_Last words... great moments in this movie and a lot of fun dialogue... even if you don't pay too close to the plot._"

So I guess it's another SNL movie. Not that it's a bad thing....i know it wasn't Nights of Roxbury kind of funny. Maybe a Baby Mama kind of funny.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that it's pretty funny. not much LOLs but it has its moments. Lots of cameos of course. Mark Ruffalo, Leighton Meester, Mark Wahlberg, Will.I.Am, Mila Kunis and James Franco. Of course I was so happy when James Franco appeared. I mean, ever since I had that dream about him being my boyfriend last week, I became obsessed with him. hahaha! So thanks to him, I ended up loving the movie. lol.\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B+.  I think its funnier than Baby Mama and the woman screaming in the theater just added that LMAO in this movie."

            "review": "Cameron Diaz has made a lot of crappy movies in her career, to the point that I would not consider myself a fan at all (sit through \"The Other Woman\" sometime, and then argue its merits- there aren't any). Here, Diaz finds a meaty, funny role and gives it her all.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a gold-digging teacher leaving her middle school after a year to marry Mark (Nat Faxon). She is dumped, and realizes the only way to score a rich guy is through ginormous breasts. She returns to teach at the middle school, determined to score the ten grand needed to get her boob job, and another rich guy in the form of long-term substitute teacher Scott (Justin Timberlake), who is eyeing goody-goody teaching vet Amy (a hysterical Lucy Punch). Elizabeth is also deflecting the passes of the nice guy gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel), and begins a campaign of dishonesty in order to reach her goals.\r\n\r\nWhile the script does go off the rails once in a while, Elizabeth thankfully doesn't lose her crudeness due to any life lessons learned throughout the story. She's not a lot of fun to be around, treating her coworkers and students with equal disdain, but the viewer somehow finds themselves riding this out just to see what she is going to do next. Diaz wouldn't have been my first choice for this (Melissa McCarthy would have nailed this), but she surprised me with how funny she was in an unglamourous role. The supporting cast are hot and cold, I didn't get a lot of chemistry with Diaz from either Segel or Timberlake, but the most fun was watching Elizabeth square off against Amy. Lucy Punch never takes a false step in her performance, and watching Elizabeth blithely deal with her is fantastic. The supporting student actors are also good, Elizabeth's withering honesty about their lives is almost refreshing in this day and age.\r\n\r\nJake Kasdan directs with his usual confidence, getting laughs in almost every scene. The screenplay spins its wheels in the midsection. Once we set up that Elizabeth is a bad teacher, we sit through a lot of unnecessary scenes that feel the need to drive the point home again and again (the Christmas dinner at one student's home).\r\n\r\nAll in all, \"Bad Teacher\" is a pleasant surprise, and it's too bad Diaz couldn't give us more Elizabeth Halsey thanks to a closing scene that could have generated a funny sequel. A brief television series emerged from this but way too much was changed to make it successful. A definite (* * * 1/2) out of five stars.\r\n\r\nThe Unrated version contains some physical violence, strong profanity, sexual content, some female nudity, brief male nudity, adult situations, alcohol and tobacco use, drug abuse"
