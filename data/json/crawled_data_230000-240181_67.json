Ants under a magnifying glass just aren't all that satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe upside is that there are some very cleverly crafted characters and acting even beyond that.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of probably better movies out there, especially after all this time."

Their mission is to form a profile of a serial killer known as The Puppeteer, trouble is, is that The Puppeteer turns out to be real and starts picking them off one by one.\r\n\r\nDirected by Renny Harlin and featuring a bonkers story written by Wayne Kramer, it doesn't take an FBI profiler to know what sort of film this is going to be. Featuring a cast that contains LL Cool J, Jonny Lee Miller, Patricia Vel\u00e1squez, Val Kilmer and Christian Slater, Mindhunters is undeniably preposterous cinema for the easily pleased masses, and yet it's still hugely enjoyable and isn't found wanting in the ingenuity stakes. \r\n\r\nThe killers secret is closely guarded, which keeps the Ten Little Indians (yes this is another Agatha cover version) like mystery going, and the manner of the deaths have a morbid freshness about them - with one in particular being outrageously thrilling. A few scenes are neatly crafted by Harlin, who is after all is no slouch in the action genre (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight), while the swimming pool finale is taut and tight and the killer reveal genuinely a surprise. \r\n\r\nYes there's problems abound in the film, but isn't there always in this kind of \"B\" movie hogwash? The cast do what is required as they work through some pretty naff dialogue, and any expectation about caring for any of these characters should be set at option zero. However, it's a nice fit for Harlin, as it finds him comfortable in the knowledge that we want whizz bang murder death kill, and thus he delivers. Expectation of anything else is pure folly and one directs you towards Ren\u00e9 Clair's excellent 1945 film, And Then There Were None if you need something a bit more solid in your murder mystery diet. 7/10"

With dire consequences coming her way if she can not solve the mystery....\r\n\r\nThe sentence, English language remake of successful foreign horror film has been known to instill fear of the wrong kind in many a genre fan. So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.\r\n\r\nStarring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger (adapting from K\u00f4ji Suzuki's novel) successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, because after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock theme that is driving Rachel on. So as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take a hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's the kind of impact that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThough the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its meaty structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. However, with much relief he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up previously. The ending here works a treat, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating? \r\n\r\nWhat is left though is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller - come horror film. One that even on revisits manages to bother and keep one on the edge of the seat. It made an $80 million profit in America alone, ensuring that a sequel was sure to follow. Now was that one a bad idea! 8/10"

It's nothing deep or massively meaningful, but it's good family fun that the younger audiences will probably largely like. It doesn't feel Disney-esque, I will say that.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of instantly noticeable voices in the cast. Steve Buscemi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jennifer Tilly and Judi Dench all appear as Wesley, Buck, Grace and Mrs. Caloway respectively. Away from them, Randy Quaid does well as Alameda Slim, while Sam Levine is mildly amusing as the Willie Brothers.\r\n\r\nPremise-wise it's nothing standout or entirely memorable, but I had a nice enough time watching it unfold and that's all you really ask for. Solid film."

            "review": "Gazillions of babes frolicking around in showgirl costumes and lingerie\r\n\t\r\nIn mid-20\u2019s Chicago Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) find themselves on death row for murdering their lovers and fan the fame that will keep them from the gallows with the assistance of a slick lawyer (Richard Gere). John C. Reilly plays Roxie\u2019s likable but dimwitted husband while Latifah is on hand as the avaricious prison matron.\r\n\r\nPeople criticize this amusing satirical musical for being sleazy, but it would be hard to lampoon and ridicule the corrupt targets of the media and the legal (in)justice system without showing, um, sleaze. That's the point of the original 1926 play \u201cChicago\u201d and all its successive incarnations, including this acclaimed 2002 movie: illustrating and sarcastically denouncing sleaze via a droll musical. \u201cChicago\u201d without sleaze would be akin to \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d without war.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the movie is based on real women, Beulah Annan (represented by Roxie) and Belva Gaertner (Velma), who were imprisoned for killing lovers in spring, 1924, in two unrelated incidents. The actual accounts were salacious with loads of sex & violence; and both were ultimately acquitted. Maurine Dallas Watkins wrote the original play, which was intended as a stinging satire of the lack of morals in Chicago during the roaring 20s. Watkins was, interestingly, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune who covered the popular trials and is represented by Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski) in the film. Several of the peripheral characters are also based on real-life individuals who played a part in the unfolding drama, e.g. journalists, attorneys, officials and convicts.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not big on musicals beyond ones like \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d (1952) and \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d (1939), but \u201cChicago\u201d works for me simple due to the scores of beautiful women prancing around in scanty showgirl apparel of the 20s. It\u2019s the same reason I love figure skating. After the passage of the 19th Amendment, American women were basking in their newfound freedoms and \u201cChicago\u201d depicts this euphoric emancipation.\r\n\r\nI also appreciate \u201cChicago\u201d because Gere is great and there are some creative pieces, like the puppet one and the tap-dancing part. All the musical skits are in Roxie\u2019s imagination, except for the opening \u201cAll that Jazz\u201d performed by Velma at the club and the climatic one, which features both Velma & Roxie.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"

            "review": "***Meditation on the nature of guilt and redemption with Billy Bob Thornton and Morgan Freeman***\r\n\r\nReleased in 2003 and written/directed by Ed Solomon, \u201cLevity\u201d concerns a man in the Great Lakes region (Billy Bob Thornton) who\u2019s released from prison after 23 years of confinement. He returns to the big city where he murdered a 17 year-old cashier and finds lodging & work at a community house run by a priest with edge (Morgan Freeman). Seeking forgiveness, he pursues a relationship with the sister of the boy he killed (Holly Hunter) while helping a wild young woman who lacks adult guidance and is wasting her life (Kirsten Dunst).\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the title, \"Levity\" can be traced to this conversation: \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d \u201cGravity.\u201d \u201cIt doesn't last long.\u201d So \u2018Levity\u2019 is meant as the opposite of gravity and graveness. It stems from the Latin root \u2018levis,\u2019 which means \"light in weight\u201d or even \"changeableness.\" It means \"lightness\u201d in every respect. Life is tragic and painful. We do senseless, unkind things to one another in various states of spiritual growth and immaturity. We spend our whole lives being dragged down to our inescapable end (\"Gravity kills\"). But we sooner or later must let go of this gravity and realize that there is joy to be had. Redemption is the return of that joy, that Levity.\r\n\r\nCritics argued that the flick could really use some levity in light of it being burdened by dour self-importance and a heavy-handed moral. The tone is similar to other spiritual movies, like \u201cGrand Canyon\u201d (1991) and \u201cThe Woodsman\u201d (2004), but not as effective in overall quality. One problem is there\u2019s a little too much ambiguity and another is the weakly executed subplot about the woman\u2019s juvenile delinquent son and his violent gang proclivities, which comes off wholly contrived. \r\n\r\nStill, there\u2019s enough good here to recommend to those who appreciate the kinds of films noted above, films that try to balance the reverence and beauty of life with the profane, foolish and ugly. I loved the way Dunst\u2019 character rolled with the inner city youth. Actually, all four main cast members shine in their roles.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in Montreal.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"

Elizabeth Mitchell is decent as Carol, while Spencer Breslin - who is good in <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em>, and yes I like that film - fits his character well. My point being, this has a slightly improved support cast.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the premise itself, it's nothing to take seriously of course but I felt suitably entertained by it. Intrigued to see where the second sequel goes."

Yet even allowing for the old \u201cleave the brain at the door\u201d requirement for such action comic malarkey, the script is too poor, the acting equally so, while the choreography is weak. The latter of which a big misstep when you have Jet Li and Mark Dacascos fronting the good guy/bad guy axis of the story.\r\n\r\nPlot pitches Li\u2019s ass kicking detective with DMX\u2019s urban thief together as an unlikely buddy buddy combo trailing missing diamonds and DMX\u2019s kidnapped daughter, and that\u2019s pretty much it. There\u2019s no attempts to expand the characters or add some emotional depth to what is meant to be a pretty critical situation.\r\n\r\nIt often feels tired, like a recycling of so many other film\u2019s of similar ilk, originality is out the window here, hell they even get Tom Arnold in to reprise a watered down version of his character from True Lies. Gabrielle Union and Kelly Hu are on hand to add the sexy sizzle in thankless roles, while Dacascos barely registers as an uber villain.\r\n\r\nLazy and redundant, all told, a waste of time for cast and viewers alike. 4/10"

I wouldn't, though, know if it works well with the exact storyline, given this film connects to what occurs on the small screen; I was an on/off watcher at best.\r\n\r\nHilary Duff (Lizzie) and Adam Lamberg (Gordo) work together nicely, but it's a slight shame that Lalaine (Miranda) doesn't appear - I recall liking her in the show. Elsewhere, Alex Borstein (Ungermeyer) and Yani Gellman (Paolo) are solid.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing overly memorable, and it isn't far ahead from being a bad film; the ending drags out, especially the music performance. However, all in all, I'm satisfied after viewing <em>'The Lizzie McGuire Movie'</em>."
