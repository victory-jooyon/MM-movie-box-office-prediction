Most of all I would recommend it to Batman fans, because there's a couple of tiny little off-the-cuff references you'll get an extra kick out of, but it'll also work for fans of the original _Lego Movie_, and for kids too.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._"

            "review": "_By JD Phillips, geekr.org_\r\n\r\nThe Harry Potter movies are great but one of the main flaws of the original franchise was the struggle the films had condensing the lengthy novels into movies under three hours. Despite the Fantastic Beasts sequel not being based on a book, it still somehow feels like its stressing to condense a five hundred page book into a smaller narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie runs from scenario to scenario so quickly that it\u2019s hard to remember what all happened in its muddled story. That\u2019s not to say the film is terrible at all, surprisingly. For a movie that has serious pacing problems throughout and has more interest in setting up sequels than it is at finding a memorable plot of its own, it\u2019s actually very entertaining.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe returning cast members are all back and while none leave quite the impression they did before they\u2019re all still entertaining in their own way. Newt is back but the movie doesn\u2019t seem nearly as interested in him and his magical monsters than it is with all of the new elements. Redmayne is still terrific in the role, however, and makes the character much more interesting than the script does by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob and Tina are back as well though both of their stories are shelved for most of the film and completely forgotten in the final moments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise though is that Queenie gets the best arc of any character in the movie. She was one of the more interesting characters in the original and while many of the twists in the film fall flat, the one involving her character was my favorite moment of the entire movie. I\u2019m more excited to see her story resolved than I am most of the other elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone who has seen the trailers that the new characters kind of take over the film from the returning players. Jude Law and Johnny Depp\u2019s Dumbledore and Grindelwald are what this film is more focused on than any other plot element.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth veteran actors shine so much that the movie loses energy when they aren\u2019t on screen. Law effortlessly settles into Dumbledore\u2019s twinkly-eyed wise, yet manipulative schtick.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepp also kills it as Grindelwald. In fact, it pains me to say this because of how much of an ass the actor is in real life, this is the most I\u2019ve liked Depp as a performer since his first time playing Jack Sparrow. He avoids most of the oddball antics he\u2019s been milking for so many years and delivers a subdued, terrifying performance as Grindelwald. He more than holds his own against Ralph Fiennes, which is saying something.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new players are a mixed bag. Zoe Kravitz\u2019s Leta Lastrange is an interesting character but none of the others really stand out. Newt\u2019s brother Theseus is a particularly big missed opportunity. The film never adequately explains what caused the rivalry between the two Scamanders and it all gets resolved before there\u2019s a chance to go into it more. Claudia Kim\u2019s Nagini may have caused a big stir when she was announced in one of the trailers but very little is actually done with her character. It feels more like a stunt than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest stunt comes from the big reveal in the end featuring Ezra Miller\u2019s Credence. There\u2019s a huge twist that not only breaks established history but feels extremely forced. For one, the movie never really explains how Credence came back to life in the first place. It feels like Ezra Miller became a bigger commodity for DC since he is the Flash so now the franchise is committing more to him than initially intended. There was no hint at all in the first movie that he was secretly connected to existing characters in a big way, so it seems out of left field. Regardless, I love Ezra Miller and hope the twist gets him better material in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie doesn\u2019t feel much like a Fantastic Beasts franchise anymore but when it does focus on its titular magical creatures, it really shines. The design and concept of the creatures lead to some of the best visuals of the entire Harry Potter pantheon. In fact, it feels like a real shame that we can\u2019t get a smaller franchise that is just about Newt\u2019s magical zoological adventures. The quieter moments of the movies where Newt is just connecting with a magical animal on its own terms are truly beautiful. Unfortunately, these moments get overtaken by the larger story around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like this franchise is straining to be two different franchises at the same time. It would almost make more sense to separate them into a smaller scale \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise and a larger scale \u201cCrimes of Grindelwald\u201d franchise. This mishmash of different ideas is feeling a little too much like the Hobbit films.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow though, despite all of the messiness of the movie\u2019s screenplay, I still found myself entertained throughout. While it may never hit the heights of its legendary predecessors, this film easily proves that the Wizarding World still has lots of magic left. Maybe the executives at Warner Bros should consider other avenues like television or other films so that Newt\u2019s film series doesn\u2019t carry the weight of one of the most magical film series ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d may not rise to the levels one would hope for, it still proves itself to be worth your time, if even just for one viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n**7.0**"

There is simply no reason for this to be 155 minutes long, there's so much unnecessary faffing about. There's a fantastic spine to the film, but it's just flooded by lameness.\r\n\r\nRanbir Kapoor is entertaining in the lead, he very much commits to the role of Jagga - he's amusing but does have a few moments of heart also. Katrina Kaif (Shruti) and Saswata Chatterjee (Bagchi) support Kapoor extremely well. A few of the others, like Saurabh Shukla, are decent too.\r\n\r\nThe music is pretty good, the core premise has potential and the cinematography et al. is solid. I'm not completely sold on how the story is told, I mostly liked it but the back and forth nature does annoy in a few parts.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's worth a watch - but snappier pacing would've raised this film up higher in my ratings."

Sometimes its common that some films comes out without my knowledge, particularly non-Hollywood English language films. This British film was about a wealthy couple from the New York, especially the husband who tries his best to fulfill his seriously ill wife's dream to be an opera singer. The problem is she's not any good. Not just him, but everybody who is close to them and once laughed at her, try to understand them and give their support. But not all the occasion seems to remain the same. So on one such a big event, the disaster strikes and how it affects the couple is the rest of the tale to disclose.\r\n\r\nA very surprising film. I thought it was just a comedy like it brings small smiles on our face, but I laughed out loud on many occasions. This is definitely a right time, because I felt like it was a music and cinematic version of the American presidential candidate Don Trump. Yep, there not much difference, but still this film is some way inspiring, not Trump. It says you must never give up on your dream. As much as you laugh watching it, as much you realise how hard chasing a dream to be if one is very passionate about something, but does not have the talent to reach the height. The message is very similar to the film 'Eddie the Eagle'. Do you think everybody got talent in the world, so I believe you should watch this and you will know why I'm telling you to watch it.\r\n\r\nWhen I read about the film's storyline, I thought it was so silly. But when I learnt it is a biographical film, that interested me to have a look at it. It is truly an unbelievable film, in a sense of humour and overall a good way. The couple was rich, so they could do anything they want just like what Donald Trump believes. But both the things are not the same, especially this one is more about the real life struggle against the odds. In some parts, it gets more emotional and I loved that final line said by the wife. It's always, the participation that counts, not how you fared it.\r\n\r\nOh my god, another Oscars nominee is almost certain for the record holder Meryl Streep. Hugh Grant was equally amazing and this is one of the best of him I have seen, particularly in the recent times. One of the best main roles for Simon Helberg, he was not next best after the Streep and Grant. I still feel this film is underrated. The director of 'Phenomena' was very good at handling the stuff for the film to get its best shape. I think this is one of this year's must see film and surely recommend it to all.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"

I don't know these actors or the director, but that's not the reason I did not enjoy it. The story was average, like it was inspired by the Keanu Reeve's 'John Wick'. I mean, how far a man can go to avenge his pet animal's murder, but here it was a rescue mission. Maybe that's how they got the title, just kidding. A very interesting theme, but not a well written screenplay. This story lacks the clever scenes and dialogues. The comedies were not bad, but I've seen better one in a similar style.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins decide to hangout when one of them is going through the breakup thing with his girlfriend and the other one's family is going on a vacation. Seems everything is fine after they receive an unexpected guest, a kitty to cheer them, but when it goes missing, they plan to track him to get back. So the mission begins and they pose as the notorious drug dealers and go through many hurdles, but will they succeed is what the film is to reveal in the final act.\r\n\r\nWhen the film posters released, I already lost interest in this. Because those imitating posters of other famous films were totally unimpressive. Beside, those kind of idea is old, not anymore fun and I'm tired of them. This is a below average film, but a decent B movie. The production was top notch, but the film did not deliver with the same standards. The twist was good, in the end, it was very common. If you are okay with a simple and silly concept, then this would do just fine.\r\n\r\n_4/10_"
