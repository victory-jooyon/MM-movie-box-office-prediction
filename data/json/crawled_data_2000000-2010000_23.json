            "review": "Young Adult tells the story of 37-year-old Mavis Gary \u2013 a pathologically unhappy, immature, egotistical girl in a grown woman's body. Upon hearing of her ex-boyfriend's new born baby, she decides that they are still meant for each other, and the fact that he is now happily married to The Perfect Woman is but a minor detail on their road to eternal bliss. More simply put\u2026 Mavis is bat s*** crazy.\r\n\r\nGoing into this movie, I thought it was going to be a hilarious comedy, full of LOL moments. Actually it is nothing of the sort. Thinking about it, seeing the way this \"adult\" woman lives out her life (sleeping till noon, living in a pigsty, forgetting to take care of her dog and playing children's video games), is really incredibly sad. No, it's pathetic. She is the author of 'young adult' books, which in any other case is a perfectly fine job, except in hers it basically means she vicariously lives the life of her main character \u2013 a high school girl. This is the emotional level Mavis is stuck in.\r\n\r\nHearing about her ex-boyfriend's baby stirs an awkward obsession in Mavis. She packs her bags and returns to her small hometown in Minnesota \u2013 completely convinced that she and her ex Buddy are destined to be together. Back home, it's obvious the people she left behind know her a little better than she knows herself. Basically, everybody knows her\u2026 and everybody hates her. And who can blame them\u2026 Mavis is quite simply the most childish, entitled, RIDICULOUSLY selfish woman there ever was. Thankfully there's at least one old acquaintance from her past who's willing to look beyond all that. His name is Matt, he walks with a crutch because he once was the victim of a horrible hate crime, and he is the only one who listens to her.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about this story is the fact that, although it starts out as a comedy, it gradually flows and meanders into a beautifully crafted, delicate character drama. Mavis, at first sight, is a hysterical character, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this woman has some deep seeded issues, no matter how hard she tries to cover up for it. Mavis is played wonderfully by Charlize Theron, who delivers one of her most hilarious, yet at the same time, understated performances to date. She could have easily gone overboard with this character, but somehow manages to humanize this completely unlikable woman. In fact, I'm willing to state that about 80% of Young Adult 'works' because of her. She displays some of her best work in two very intense scenes, where Mavis' sky high ego comes crashing down, leaving her remarkably exposed and vulnerable. That right there was some truly wonderful acting on her part.\r\n\r\nMatt is played very amiably by Patton Oswalt, who seems to be the only character in town with any emotional intelligence. Although this character may be a bit of a clich\u00e9 (the wise, sympathetic loser with a physical disability and a traumatizing past), that's OK because it works. Oswalt's acting clearly takes a shot at versatility and he passed with flying colours, as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI love the script. Penned by Diablo Cody (writer of Juno), it's full of sharp, sassy character traits and dialogue, while remaining very subtle and human. As a story, it doesn't honestly have that much to offer but it's a joy to watch for the high quality of 'human relatableness', I guess I could call it. Actually, I can't really think of any major flaws. It has an awesome soundtrack, all the actors are very well cast and the direction was placed perfectly in the very capable hands of Jason Reitman.\r\n\r\nThis is a small film, about basic, non-glamorous human behavior and a big girl who might find happiness yet, if only she wants it badly enough. Highly recommended.\r\n_(January 2015)_"

            "review": "In one of the most mediocre movies so far this year, \u201cBloodshot\u201d squanders every last positive thing it has going for it. Based on the bestselling sci-fi comic book, the film tells the story of recently killed soldier Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) who is brought back to life as a super-assassin. Ray has an army of nanotechnology in his veins, making him an outrageously strong, unstoppable force who has the ability to instantly heal any injuries he sustains in combat. When his memories begin to contradict what\u2019s reality and what\u2019s fiction, Ray starts to suspect lead scientist Dr. Harting (Guy Pearce) may have sinister intentions \u2014 and he does everything in his superhuman power to stop him.\r\n\r\nThe film lacks enough material for a feature length film, and it feels like the story has been stretched out from the get-go. The plot is far-fetched but interesting, yet the best elements are dismissed in a rushed fashion. The film could\u2019ve gone one of two ways, and it chooses the path of greatest disappointment, which leaves it in this weird limbo. It\u2019s not quite smart enough and not quite dumb enough to work. Like when director Dave Wilson gets the sense that things are lagging, he inserts a not-so-subtle explosion or dick joke to keep things moving along. Yeah, it\u2019s that kind of bad.\r\n\r\nEven the action scenes fall victim to rapid-fire editing that is intended to disguise the bloodless PG-13 action flick. There\u2019s an almost-satisfying extended fight sequence involving elevators and a skyscraper, but it comes late in the film when most audiences will likely have already lost interest. Even worse, there are no consequences because Ray can\u2019t be hurt or killed, and the special effects look like they were created in a couple of hours by a pre-teen boy on the family room laptop.\r\n\r\nDiesel is not a great actor, but that\u2019s never been a job requirement to bring the charismatic, cinematic muscle to the big screen. He\u2019s a perfectly acceptable action star, but here he turns in a laughably bad performance. His poor acting hogs the spotlight, especially when he shares scenes opposite the talented Pearce.\r\n\r\nThis movie is absolute junk that will die a quick death at the box office. Please, audiences: do your part to put \u201cBloodshot\u201d out of its misery."

The only viable link is that both children are writing a story...\r\n\r\nA joint Spanish/English language production, Intruders is the sort of frustrating picture that has big and bold ideas on the page, but sadly on the screen in unfolds laboriously as it bites off more than it can chew. It came as no surprise to myself to find that upon opening internet sites frequented by horror fans, Intruders has greatly disappointed them. It's rarely frightening, sags desperately in the middle section, the pay off is weak, and ultimately it only skirts the boundaries of being a \"horror\" film.\r\n\r\nSo, the lack of shocks and suspense in bona fide horror terms needs to be tempered with genre expectation levels, this is more a family drama with fantastical horror elements lurking around the edges of the frame. This of course doesn't help anyone, like myself, who has bought into plot synopsis and the marketing strategy that accompanied the picture, but if able to see past the faceless demon that appears occasionally and promises something else? There's a decent and honest adult film pulsing away here.\r\n\r\nClive Owen plays the troubled father of the piece and he once again, as he did in Trust, shows that given this type of material he can deliver a performance of emotional substance. He's backed up by a very strong turn from young Ella Purnell as his daughter, and with the tech credits high - most notably Roque Ba\u00f1os' superb musical score - there is much to enjoy here. But as thoughtful as it is, and as solid as the film makers credentials are, it's reputation is unlikely to be enhanced anytime soon. 6.5/10"

It helps that he is playing a doofy character.\r\n\r\nThis story is just as complicated as real life, but as ridiculous as it is, it's not believeable enough to break the immersion.  The story is written as multi-threaded in a great way.\r\n\r\nNed is a great every man, and an embodiment of purity.  His only real flaw is wanting to be good and just.\r\n\r\nIt's a charming story of the turbulences of life, filled with great acting and plenty of good humor."

            "review": "Gerade in der Originalfassung ist \u201eTed\u201c ein anarchischer Spa\u00df. Seth MacFarlane, der neben seiner Regiearbeit auch noch Ted spricht, hat ihr einen Film erschaffen, in dem kein Blatt vor den Mund genommen wird und vor allem davon lebt, dass Ted einfach in jeder Szene auf die eine oder andere Art daneben benimmt. Immer einen fiesen Spruch auf den Lippen sprudeln die Beleidigungen und unangebrachten S\u00e4tze nur so aus Ted heraus und wenn man bei menschlichen Protagonisten schnell das Gef\u00fchl hat, dass dieses Verhalten zu viel des Guten ist, kommt dies bei Ted nicht vor. Dies mag daran liegen, dass Ted eben ein Teddyb\u00e4r ist und man so ein Verhalten von einem Kuscheltier eben nicht erwartet.\r\n\r\nErstaunlich ist auch, wie gut Mark Wahlberg (Shooter, Vier Br\u00fcder) im Zusammenspiel mit dem chaotischen Teddyb\u00e4ren funktioniert. Wahlberg hat sich in den letzten Jahren ja eher in Actionfilmen und ernsteren Produktionen positioniert, zeigt aber in \u201eTed\u201c, dass er den \u201eOver the top\u201c-Humor genau beherrscht wie das Actionfach.\r\n\r\nUnd auch Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Ausgequetscht) darf man nicht vergessen. Kunis hat sich ja schon mehrfach in Kom\u00f6dien ausgetobt und beweist in \u201eTed\u201c, dass sich auch in derberen Vertretern des Genres eine gute Figur macht.\r\n\r\n\u201eTed\u201c bietet aber nicht nur derben Humor, sondern mindestens eine Szene, die in die Filmgeschichte eingehen wird, den Donnersong. Wenn John und Ted bei Gewitter im Bett liegen und ihr Lied singen und dabei das Unwetter wild beschimpfen, dann bleibt auch bei den Zuschauern kein Auge trocken, die ansonsten wenig mit dem Film anfangen k\u00f6nnen.\r\n\r\nInsgesamt gesehen ist \u201eTed\u201c allerdings kein Meisterwerk. In erster Linie nutzt Seth MacFarlane seine Erfahrung die er mit der TV-Serie \u201eFamily Guy\u201c gesammelt hat und mixt den derben Humor der Serie mit neuen Figuren. Klar, mit dem gesellschaftsuntauglichen Ted pr\u00e4sentiert er dabei eine Figur, die man so auf der Leinwand noch nicht gesehen hat, er erfindet sich allerdings mit dem Film nicht neu, sondern erschlie\u00dft mit \u201eTed\u201c nur eine neue Zielgruppe, n\u00e4mlich die Kom\u00f6dienfans, die MacFarlane noch nicht von \u201eFamily Guy\u201c kenne, aber derbe Kom\u00f6die wie z.B. \u201eHangover\u201c m\u00f6gen.

            "review": "The high-powered and hyper-kinetic \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 is a pulsating production that one would expect from the off-kilter imagination of writer-director Guy Ritchie whose flashy and furious actioners such as \u2018Snatch\u2019 and \u2018Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels\u2019 are indicative of the filmmaker\u2019s excess frivolity. So it is not much of a shock that Ritchie\u2019s big screen adaptation of the iconic 60s television series that featured the retro-suave Robert Vaughn and golden-haired heart-breaker David McCallum takes on a sleek, stylish and impishly erratic mix of intrigue and frolic.\r\n\r\nThe consensus is that \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 continues the wave of nifty and naughty-minded colourful espionage spectacles that seem to have invaded the summer of 2015. Perhaps when one cries \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019  it will not be as challenging or convincingly crafty as the more cerebral and stimulating \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019. Still, Ritchie\u2019s off-beat serving of \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 is mindless fun and roguishly cheeky.\r\n\r\nSure, at times the boisterous bounce in \u2018U.N.C.L.E/\u2019 feels rather strained as Ritchie\u2019s foray into the James Bond-esque territory featuring the off-balance smoothness of twitchy twosome  Brit Henry Cavill (the \u2018Man of Steel\u2019 star portraying American CIA Agent Napoleon Solo) and Armie Hammer (incidentally sporting a catchy and clever moniker) as Russian KGB Agent Illya Kuryakin spirals into a cliched cavalcade of mischievousness drowned out by surging surf music, crazy-minded and bright-coloured landscapes, perfect-looking protagonists and wildly penetrating predicaments in its manufactured action sequences. Nevertheless, \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 still generates a sense of rousing charm and insane impishness to carry out its agenda for off-the-cuff espionage escapist frolicking.\r\n\r\nSome may not mind the make-up of \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 as a saucy buddy action flick in disguise as Cavill and Hammer drolly inhabit the kooky coolness of TV\u2019s dynamic duo spies from yesteryear. Nobody will ever claim that Cavill and Hammer are trying to ape the small screen spying antics of original U.N.C.L.E. bad boys in the aforementioned Vaughn and McCallum any time soon. The exaggerated juiced-up chase scenes, the inclusion of high-volume spunk and wit, devious femme fatales that parade around as hormonal trophies\u2026all add to the high-wire hedonism of Ritchie\u2019s off-centered international gun-toting caper.\r\n\r\nRitchie\u2019s co-written screenplay, along with Lionel Wigham of \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019 fame with \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 producer credits, does not provide much of a deep-seeded story other than its need to indulge the audience in its shifty shenanigans as an over-the-top ode to a classic couple of televised operatives that baby-boomers will fondly recall from their childhood reminiscences. The premise is somewhat painfully familiar as two clashing spy guys with different approaches to the espionage game join at the hip to stop a madman planning to engineer nuclear destruction for a vulnerable world. Of course, in attempting to stop such unthinkable madness we are overcome with the philosophical tactics and mannerisms of the targeted tandem looking to spread some spice along the way in saving the world from certain cartoonish devastation.\r\n\r\nSolo is the capable cad whose free-spirit and ease on handling a sticky situation is met with instinctive, cavalier American ingenuity. Kuryakin, on the other hand, seems to be disciplined in his uptight \u2018play-it-by-the-book\u2019 demeanor as the cold Russian enforcer without a sense of straying from his boundaries. Together, this debonair \u2018ying-and-yang\u2019 pair of free-wheeling agents form as one in their mission to foil the demented deed of others. Isn\u2019t that special?\r\n\r\nIn essence, \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 believes in its wheeling-and-dealing hype and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It does not pretend to be anything other than what it is at large, a spry, jet-setting caper where playful doom and gloom is played out against a backdrop of elegant locales not to mention a spruced-up soundtrack to accompany the animated proceedings. As usual Ritchie punctuates his theatrical releases with loose-minded lunacy happening at a fast pace. The outlandishness of \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 is truly true to form in the tradition of the funky and frenetic fables that Ritchie loves to spin at will.\r\n\r\nBoth Cavill and Hammer seem to get inspiration out of their dressy roles as the inventive spies with a knack for carousing and chaos. The wily women that are at the center of attention for Solo\u2019s/Kuryakin\u2019s romancing interests in Elizabeth Debicki\u2019s vivacious Victoria and Alicia Vikander\u2019s toxic Gaby is refreshingly stimulating and reinforces the suspenseful jolt. As the commanding Waverly that oversees Solo and Kuryakin, Hugh Grant does not hold a candle to the late great character actor Leo G. Carroll, that was so memorable as the head honcho that pushed the buttons in the background for both Solo\u2019s \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 and later April Dancer\u2019s (Stephanie Powers) \u2018The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 \r\n\r\nSo here is to the jousting \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 enjoying its considerable A.U.N.T (\u2018A Unique Nifty Time\u2019) at the busy summertime box office.\r\n\r\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

            "review": "Joyous Outrageous Trash.\r\n\r\nHobo with a Shotgun is directed by Jason Eisener and written by John Davies. It stars Rutger Hauer, Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, Molly Dunsworth, Robb Wells and Nick Bateman. Music is by Alexander Rosborough and cinematography by Karim Hussain.\r\n\r\nA homeless hobo (Hauer) hitches a freight train lift into Hope Town and finds a city imploding with corruption, violence, drugs and sexual deviance. Initially trying to keep out of the way and get on with his meagre existence, the hobo finally cracks and decides he can no longer sit back and watch such lawlessness. Helping himself to a shotgun from the local pawn shop, hobo goes on a one man killing crusade.\r\n\r\nBorn out of a trailer that accompanied the original full release of Rodriguez/Tarrantino's Grindhouse venture, Hobo with a Shotgun is horror exploitation made with abundant glee. Blending Death Wish like vigilantism with 70s and 80s styled schlock, Jason Eisener has crafted an utterly tasteless, yet wonderfully entertaining piece of cinema. Violence is broad and completely bloody, as heads are exploded, bodies punctured and characters killed in a series of increasingly strange ways, while the characters that inhabit Hope Town are downright nasty and equally as weird. From bully boy Tom Cruise homage brother bastards Ivan & Slick, to a paedophile Santa Claus, and on to The Plague -two metal suited fetish killers sent to take out the hobo - it's welcome to bizarreville for sure.\r\n\r\nIt's all driven by a great turn from Hauer, who manages to play it with raw and subtle emotion, even as the rage takes control of him and he deals death as surely as he delivers a memorable line. Around him are a bunch of no mark actors, but this works in the films' favour, the material doesn't need star wattage to drive the motors, besides which, you will undoubtedly come out of the film remembering the characters these actors have played rather than the actors in the garbs. \r\n\r\nShot in suitably lurid Technicolor by Hussain and featuring an on the money score by Rosborough, all the elements for a Grindhouse feature fall into place. This basically does what the title suggests it will, yes it may at times veer towards crassness, and what social comment depth intended gets lost as Eisener gets carried away with the carnage. But under examination this is a whole bunch of fun that's made for adults who remember the movies from a past decade that this homages and parodies with devilish aplomb. 8/10"

            "review": "Rampart invokes a question which, in itself, is never a good sign when it comes to filmmaking. What went wrong when the end result is much lesser than the sum of its parts? \r\n\r\nHere we have the multi-talented Woody Harrelson, in the role of a psycho LA cop, flanked by great names such as Sigourney Weaver, Steve Buscemi, Ned Beatty and Robin Wright, in a film that, for all intents and purposes, offers great material and a thrilling story. Now, subtract from this sum the fact that most of these talents are shamefully underused, and then the factors of bad writing, bad direction, complete lack of build-up and the weakest ending in the history of weak endings... and what do you get? Proof that you need a lot more than a can full of great actors to make a great film, that's what.\r\n\r\nThis story is set in the late 90s. Harrelson plays Dave Brown, a Los Angeles police officer with 24 years of experience under his belt. He is a racist, misogynistic, violent brute and absolutely unashamed of it. He shares his house (and his bed) with two sisters, both of whom mothered his two daughters. At work, he will literally beat a confession out of any poor bastard under his interrogation. And when push comes to shove, he might just shove you into an early grave. Needless to say, this guy is not big on ethics. Until he himself is placed under interrogation by his superiors after he is caught using excessive force on a man who accidentally rammed his patrol car. This incident also sheds new light on a decade-old case of Dave killing an alleged rapist. All of this builds up to Dave's pending lawsuit.\r\n\r\nSo that's the basic story. Although \u2013 and this is a good thing \u2013 it's all pretty much a backdrop to a portrait of one seriously messed-up individual, and the people that get messed up by default.\r\n\r\nWriting this review, I find it hard to answer the original question. Because this is usually the part where I point out all the good things about the film, but I'm actually having trouble finding any good things to say about Rampart. Well, there's one (very!) good thing and that's Woody Harrelson. Matter of fact, he's the only reason I even finished watching. He's one of my favourite actors, so it's hard not to sound biased, but the versatility he brings to every project he's involved in, is quite astounding. And should he ever win an Oscar in the future, it will be long overdue. His portrayal of this character is absolutely convincing, but it's a shame that his performance here is almost completely wasted in this would-be art house drivel. Had this been a better film, the Academy might just have noticed him.\r\n\r\nInstead, what we're presented here is really nothing more than a lame excuse for an artistically made film. Technically, the only things that even remotely make it work are the good camera work and photography. The lighting techniques are very well applied and the image colouring and camera angles make the whole aesthetically well-made, and create an appropriate and heavy atmosphere. But that's pretty much it. Great actors completely fall by the wayside in small, uninteresting roles that could have been played by anybody. Sigourney Weaver plays a local DA which is a role that only shows her sitting behind a desk for about five minutes. Steve Buscemi plays the smallest and most insignificant role of his career as I-don't-even-know-who, and has no more than maybe six lines of dialogue. I don't know why he even bothered to show up. Robin Wright plays an attorney, whose relevance to the story becomes more and more puzzling throughout the film. And Ned Beatty? Oh yeah, he's in there somewhere too...\r\n\r\nI should point out that the bad quality of this film is to no account of the actors, they are all very good in their roles. The fault here lies almost entirely with the bad screenplay. There is simply no proper start, zero build-up and the ending is so painstakingly unsatisfactory that it feels like a bad hangover. The structure of story-telling seems completely arbitrary and fragmented, like they just threw a whole bunch of random scenes together and decided to call it a film. Director Oren Moverman has made a few critically acclaimed films, most notably his Bob Dylan pic 'I'm Not There', but Rampart is one film I wouldn't want on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\r\n\r\nWhat's probably the biggest let-down is the lack of shock value. The premise of Rampart is that it's about the incredibly violent nature of this one \"all-American\" police officer. And it's true, the things he says and does are pretty brutal, heartless and offensive. But all in all, it's actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm saying this not from a realistic point of view, because I think anyone who behaves like this should be behind bars, but as a film, it's just not interesting enough. The scenes depicting violence are few and far in between, and aside from the fact that he obviously uses women as a personal commodity, Dave Brown's character never really rises above your basic a**hole standard. There are \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 many more guys like this walking around, and I'm even sure there are cops worse than this one.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the film drags, the pacing is awful and in the end, it leaves you feeling utterly hollow and unsatisfied. Some people might appreciate Rampart as a vague kind of indie effort, but I'm usually one of those people. I 'get' vague. I 'get' artsy. I don't 'get' Rampart.\r\n\r\nIt's an utter waste of great talent and opportunity, and I would wish for all actors involved that this had been a better film, because they deserve it, but this film is a blemish on anyone's track record.\r\n_(October 2012)_"
