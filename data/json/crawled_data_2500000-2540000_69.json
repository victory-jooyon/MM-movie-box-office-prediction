            "review": "> The famous English detective at his old age.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen as Sherlock Holmes, totally loved it. Directed by an Oscar winning filmmaker, the film was based on the novel 'A Slight Trick of the Mind'. It focused the long retired Sherlock Holmes, who now lives in the English countryside where he meets a boy. He tries to recall one of his old cases, but struggles as he's very old to remember. So with the help of the boy, he undertakes to correct the book version of the story and besides, they together establish beekeeping as a hobby.\r\n\r\nIt was not that great, though an enjoyable small drama. Having a greatest detective character in it, you just can't expect a boring regular drama of the life. The narration had a multiple layer, in each how much Mr. Holmes dedicates himself to solves the case was nicely told. And of course, all of them had its own twist. After all, that's what everybody seeks from a film with Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you would have seen several films and/or series based on this character, but this film was something unique and only one kind, except if there's a sequel planned for this. Some people might be disappointed in this for being somewhat simple, but for a 93 year old man this storyline looked very appropriate and Ian did a fantastic job. I anticipated someone young actor for those flashback parts, but in the end, I'm happy that it was a one man show as it should be. It is a must see for his fans.\r\n\r\n7/10"

            "review": "> Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.\r\n\r\nWe all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.\r\n\r\nThe both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\r\n\r\n> \"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\r\n\r\n> \"When I was small, I only knew small things.\r\n> But now I'm five, I know everything.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.\r\n\r\nWhen a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.\r\n\r\nThere were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.\r\n\r\n9/10"

That means it is good for the grown ups to watch. The story of a 15 year old girl in the 70s living with her mother and small sister. It begins when her sexual urges takes off, her first with a middle aged man. So she documents everything and besides, with her close friend's support, they together explore even more options. Being a minor and yet her real life to commence, what she plans for the future determines the remaining developments.\r\n\r\nThe performance by Bel Powley was amazing. She was the perfect choice to play that role despite she's older than the role. There were many nudes and sex scenes, but was not that strong, especially when compared with the similar themes of the present era films. The pace had lots of ups and downs, but the progression was on the right path which actually saved the film.\r\n\r\nThe story was just fine, no complication to understand and also not easy to explain, but in a short, it was a teenage girl's sexual exploration. Everybody gets into that stage of life, but only few courageously opts a path to accomplish. And for some, it is an open opportunity that makes them to get there than intentionally make that move. I felt the film was well adapted from its book and directed by a newcomer, Surely worth a watch, but again I'm saying that it is not for everyone.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"

In fact, it was a minimal cast movie set in an isolated cabin in the woods. A simple story that is like the title, it is about a newly married couple's honeymoon. All sets off nicely to them until strange events begin to follow one after another. How the couple manages to come off of it, or do they is the rest.\r\n\r\nI don't know others, but like I said it was not a bad movie to me. Whatever happened, it just kept me engaged throughout, because of the uptight plot. Though, it raises some questions about the events that takes place in the movie and makes to have your own imagination. In fact, my opinion in the begging was 'big foot', later very quickly I understood what it's about. The writer's notion was also the same, leaving blank space to fill by the viewers with their creative prediction.\r\n\r\nThe most of the answers answered or going to be answered are merely the same (I think). For those who won't get it, will suffer nothing except think they wasted time. The rest will probably want a sequel for a proper and further explanation. Especially a couple of dialogues made me think that way. But, I don't think so there will be one, it will stay a mystery as of now forever, if I'm not wrong. Not a scary movie nor actual violence, but the suspense was the movie's strong hold. If you're looking for that type, you can give it a try other than blood gore and killings.\r\n\r\n5.5/10"

            "review": "These days one can find busy singer/dancer/actress Jennifer Lopez performing her judging duties on the small screen with the longtime singing competition \u2018American Idol\u2019. However, the still radiant and curvaceous \u2018JLo\u2019 found some time to gravitate back to the big screen and revisit the overplayed \u2018woman in peril\u2019 genre with her latest generic psychological thriller in director Rob Cohen\u2019s (\u2018The Fast And The Furious\u2019) \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019. Needlessly rehashed, rudimentary and titillating in tepidness, \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 is nothing more than a thin serving of the arbitrary \u2018damsel-in-distress\u2019 chick flicks that pop up and serve as throwaway conveyor belt melodramas. \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 will inevitably beg for obvious comparisons to ready-made Lifetime cable movies. Well, there are a decent amount of Lifetime movies that can actually give the limping \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 a run for its creative money.\r\n\r\nIn essence, Lopez is no stranger to these types of \u2018harried heroines\u2019 on the defense so she is quite comfortable in rollicking in the paper-thin premise of \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019. In forgettable 2001\u2019s \u2018Angel Eyes\u2019 and 2002\u2019s \u2018Enough\u2019 we witness Lopez\u2019s on-screen dilemma as the creepy men in her life are ominously drawn to her aura causing the heightened jeopardy at large. The case in \u2018Boy\u2019 is similar except that the delusional young man in question is as dreamy as he is deranged for the endangered cougar. Hey, he may be crazed but he is still cute, right ladies?\r\n\r\nThe reality is that we have seen this formula countless times before as \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 offers nothing fresh or feisty to the table. The teaspoon-sized tension is laughable. The run-of-the-mill steamy scenes are not even trashy enough to digest with notable suspense. Undoubtedly, \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 recklessly borrows from every psycho-thriller imaginable and still ends up looking bland and boorish. With all the loving-to-stalking fare out there past and present (ie \u2018Fatal Attraction\u2019, \u2018The Crush\u2019, \u2018Fear\u2019, \u2018Swimfan\u2019, \u2018Disclosure\u2019, \u2018Obsessed\u2019, etc.) the inclusion of \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 only clogs up the cinematic pipe in reference to this overdone genre.\r\n\r\nUnder Cohen\u2019s pedestrian direction and screenwriter Barbara Curry\u2019s spotty script \u2018Boy\u2019 tells the tale of an attractive middle-aged high school teacher named Claire Peterson (Lopez) whose bout with disillusionment will result in her tawdry affair with a neighboring handsome younger man in 19 year-old Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman from the \u2018Step It Up\u2019 movies). Before Claire falls into the arms of her youthful studmuffin she is riddled with conflict. For starters, her unfaithful husband Garrett (John Corbett, \u2018My Big Fat Greek Wedding\u2019) was banished from the house for his constant infidelities. Also, Claire\u2019s sickly teen son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is experiencing growing pains. At this point, Claire needs a positive boost in her existence as she trudges along both in the classroom and at home, where her personal life seems to be in utter shambles.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunkish Noah arrives on the scene to assist his ailing uncle across the street from the Petersons, he makes a lasting impression on the older Claire. Noah is helpful to Claire and becomes sort of the manly mentor that her son Kevin needs to capture his adolescent confidence. Of course, Noah\u2019s backstory is quite suspicious (such as his parents\u2019 so-called mysterious death) but the oozing charm and good company that the older teen offers the stressed Claire is too convenient to pass up. Noah is just too good to be true and Claire has found a young man worthy of entertaining both her and Kevin.\r\n\r\nThe yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher's preferred pet to Lopez's lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR\r\nThe yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher\u2019s preferred pet to Lopez\u2019s lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR\r\nIn the aftermath of a horrible date arranged by her close friend and school vice principal Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth), Claire lets down her guard and succumbs to her sexual urge for Noah in a hasty moment of passion. Realizing that perhaps her bedtime dalliance with Noah was a mistaken indiscretion Claire informs Noah that they can no longer go on and act upon their carnal connection. This does not sit well with Noah at all. Soon, Claire will experience the psychotic wrath of her scorned young admirer whose smothering need to be with her becomes hauntingly overwhelming. The stakes are dangerously higher when the forgiven Garrett re-enters the picture in an effort to win back Claire\u2019s broken heart.\r\n\r\nOverall, the low-budgeted \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 simply fills in the cheesy blanks with its amateurish jitters. Lopez\u2019s angst-ridden Claire has all the frightened chops of a ransom hayride during a busy livestock convention. The lackluster acting by leads Lopez and Guzman are not impish or impulsive enough to care one way or the other. Corbett\u2019s cheating hubby Garrett feels like a mere footnote in the flaccid proceedings.

There were moments were I went \u201cOh Harry\u2019s used that same spell before!\u201d or characters that fitted naturally into the narrative being mentioned, as opposed to getting all _Agents of SHIELD_ season 1 on us, and awkwardly name-dropping something from the other films every 5 minutes, just in case we forgot, which was what I was afraid it might do.\r\n\r\nEnd result, _Fantastic Beasts_ is a flawed film that I was still very happy to have watched, and exceeded my expectations.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._"

Communism and United States are like two opposite poles. So portraying an American who supports it is a challenging task for any moviemakers. But the director of 'Meet the Parents' did a great job. Yep, you don't have to take sides while a watch. Of course, the movie discussed the issue of conflict over the types of ruling system, but it was only in the initial part that kind of looked strong. While the story advancing, that topic completely weakened and concentrated more on other stuffs. So don't expect it to be a fight for the constitutional, but a wonderful biography of one of the talented screenwriters in the history of Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCommunism or Democracy, whatever you support that does not matter here to choose whether you want watch it or not. Because this movie very smartly outlined how people are affected when they believe differently from the majority of others around. In the opening, I thought it could be an anti-hero tale, but later it transformed the angle of presentation and indeed in the end the main character turned into a most likeable one.\r\n\r\nI liked Dalton Trumbo, not for what he preferred to support, but how he handled it all. The rival group is who made it a big concern, otherwise he is a neglectable for his egoist nature. Bryan Cranston was amazing in the title role. It's his best in the lead role, after only to the 'Breaking Bad'. Hope he's going to make more lead role films now after. Kind of of inspiring flick, of course, from his professional angle. Definitely one of the best films of the 2015 and deserved its Oscar nod.\r\n\r\n8/10"

            "review": "> Going across the Atlantic to find the lost love.\r\n\r\nA western movie set in the 1870 United States, but entirely shot in the New Zealand. The story of a 16 year old boy, Jay, from Scotland embarks a journey in the New World in search of his love, Rose. Later a bounty hunter joins him and makes sure his safe travel. Technically, it was a road movie, but reveals the plot from the other angles as well in the spare times like during camping at the nights.\r\n\r\nThe narration was too slow and the story was ordinary, but it was enough for me to get engaged. If you wait until the final scene, especially till you figure out the puzzle of the romance theme, you may like it better. The end was so good, just like what a western movie fan looking for, a gunfight. Interestingly, that was not to be heroic, except all the earlier disasters pushed for the finale and the post finale. It is rated R, because it is so brutal in some way and for being faithful to the genre.\r\n\r\nIt might not be a dream debut for the director like the big cast, the high budget and a great commercial success, but giving a satisfying movie in a simple way was his accomplishment in his first attempt. Kodi Smith-McPhee is almost 20 and he's yet to play his independent and powerful enough character that will bring acknowledgement. It was a close one, the narration started like it was his, and he was everywhere in the movie. Then going further, especially when it nears the end, he was kind of fading. But he was awesome, along with Michael Fassbender. Not a must see, as well as not refusable if you get a chance to see it.\r\n\r\n7.5/10"

I don't know what's the reason, but surprisingly it was a much better film than I expected. It had a decent cast, particularly for a small budget horror, it was a well made film. Even the screen-writing was good. They should have improved it a bit, but still not a bad film with all the fine performances.\r\n\r\nThis is about a man who can enter the minds of the possessed ones by the evil spirits. Like most of the horror films, the exorcist has a person feud with one particular spirit. So after searching for it many years, he finds that a boy was possessed by the same spirit. Now it's his time to avenge whatever he had suffered from earlier in his life.\r\n\r\nThe horror film fans and film fanatics might think it is an average, but for the common people it will work fine. There are some good moments in the film. Overall, well designed film in those crucial parts. You are going to see totally a different Aaron Eckhart, especially being in the lead. So I feel it is worth a try.\r\n\r\n_6\u00bd/10_"

So the flashback begins, just like an unofficial sequel to 'The Passion of the Christ', the story continues after the crucifiction of Yeshua.\r\n\r\nSealed the tomb with the roman mark and guarded it by an armed force, the body of Yeshua goes missing. With the widespread speculation going around and the order from a higher authority, the Roman soldiers led by Clavius attempts to locate the body by following the hints. So the rest of the story is racing against the time where many unexpected and strange events follows.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect setting for a tale like this. The characters were good, but in the end it certainly questions their actions based in what purpose. It was told from a Roman perspective and his transformation to what he ultimately believes.\r\n\r\nThe details were good while depicting the events. A simple narration with not so fancy stunts and others tricks, yet somewhere it loses its realistic approach to the supernatural thing.\r\n\r\nSince they did not mention anything related to the real account, it is fairly debatable yet not worth debating seriously. Because different people have different opinion regarding religious, historical and entertainment angle. But absolutely this film is target every one of them.\r\n\r\nThis kind of films is worth watching, because each writer, filmmaker gives us a different take on the person who is behind the world's largest faith. So 'liked it' or 'didn't like' should come after the view. Though it was a quite enjoyable film.\r\n\r\n6/10"

            "review": "> An innovative horror-drama with a simplicity.\r\n\r\nIt was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.\r\n\r\nI have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.\r\n\r\nIt does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.\r\n\r\nNow I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.\r\n\r\n8/10"

Reminded me the Korean film 'Memories of Murder', but not the same or similar, except the crime scenario and the location. Awesome to see a detective story that takes place outside the urban area. The Spanish countryside was so beautiful, those marshlands, especially from the aerial views.\r\n\r\nI think the brilliant cinematography is the first thing anyone would notice and the 80s atmosphere. The narration was steady as the crime after the crime with tension arise, while on the other side the investigation advancing till the last minute to reveal the truth.\r\n\r\nThe two cops were so good, along the murder mysteries they're working on. Beside these two men are the characters with riddles. Not only to each others, but for us as well. Not easy to predict anything, also there are some loose ends to have our own perspective regarding the story puzzle. The overall impression is its a fine mystery-crime, but still I felt that I did not enjoy entirely due to the lack of originality. Other than that I'm sure it is worth a watch.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd/10"

It was from the 'The Tournament' director and has a good cast. De Niro playing a small role is a disappointment, but for his age it was not bad. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was good, but as most of the story takes place on a moving bus, it was not a performance based film, just a crime-thriller with some action sequences.\r\n\r\nThe story of a single father who needs a big sum for his daughter's operation. So he decides to rob a casino where he works which actually goes wrong and end up in a bus with the hostages. The casino men and the cops, both are after him, he's certainly got trapped without any option to get away with it is the film that ends with a decent climax scene.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Gina Carano in 'Haywire', I thought she might be the next big thing in the female action star world, but disappointed with how her career shaped up. Even for this film the role was not up to her caliber. The story was the film's strength, but if you are focused you could predict some of the scenes. Really well shot film, the production was good and this is where the big stars and the B movie meets. Seen a lot worse than this, so quite enjoyable and instantly forgettable film.\r\n\r\n6/10"

People who can't manage their emotions as if they don't have them get sent to a place where they're basically electro-shocked into committing suicide if they hadn't beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe tension of it definitely ramps up a bit, but the focus eventually becomes more on the romantic connection than survival, even during a part primarily focused on surviving.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of scenes are really subtle too, I actually had to re-watch them to just to make sure I knew how it ended.\r\n\r\nSo while I like it and there is definitely something to like here, I think less people than more are going to be into it."

            "review": "> From an action packed flick to a game mode!\r\n\r\nThe first film was a decent entertainer, I kind of liked that and a box office hit as well. So the producers saw an opportunity to bring another film and yep, this film did slightly better than the original, but the product was qualityless. The graphics were just okay, but overall very poor in those blow-up scenes which were the most essential for a theme like this.\r\n\r\nNot all, though some of the action sequences were terrible and the story was very weak. In fact, there's no story, the whole film was an action- thriller just like the previous film. But that's how this theme revolves, yet as a one, it is a bit disappointing follow-up without surprises. Anyway, I'm with the original film director who backed out of the project for giving him a bad script to direct.\r\n\r\nSo the London is the latest victim of the plot for the US president's assassination. Particularly this 2nd part looked so much more alike a computer game than actors who are exhibiting their roles. Like the London is a battlefield and level after level the story making its progress till the game over, but we know who wins in the end. I don't know whose performance was much better, because I did not find anyone with par to appreciate.\r\n\r\nWhat this film did at the box office was a miracle, so I don't think the filmmakers go for another script anytime soon. But if they do, I'm wondering which capitol would be the next victim of a terror attack. Expecting Tokyo or Canberra, especially Mumbai would be an ideal location. This is not a bad film, you can try it once, but watching it like sitting next to who's with xbox joystick.\r\n\r\n6/10"

            "review": "> The youthfulness ever presence, despite the living matter nears to cease.\r\n\r\nHalf a year ago the first look poster of this movie's stirred everyone including myself. Not seen such kind of posters for even movies like 'Blue is the Warmest colour' and 'Nymphomaniac I & II'. It is obvious the director of the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA winner for the movie 'The Great Beauty' delivered another similar ordinary concept about extraordinary fictional personalities. And the way of their life, especially when they meet the difficulties at some point of their lives.\r\n\r\nFrom all, the casting of Michael Caine caught my interest on this. This is another wonderful movie with the hard work of the fine cast and the crew. There is a good chance for the movie in the upcoming Oscar and other prestigious awards node in a couple of categories, including for the Caine's performance. Because it looks like made for awards, rather breaking records at the box office.\r\n\r\nWhatever the topic of the movie is, 'love' stands at the centre of the web. Human affections for each others, losing someone you love and at a same time falling for another. All about passing through 'love' in the life and in which, how strong is our grip on it to carry along with us to the end of the life was illustrated pretty compelling way.\r\n\r\nThe theme was bold, and everything shown was realistic. But it also makes some illusions to brief the other side of reality. For instance, a Buddhist monk who demonstrates his peaceful achievement, a fat man kicking a tennis ball high in the air et cetera, all these are the youthfulness of who are no more youths, citing as a desire for beyond their limits which is obviously what the title implies.\r\n\r\nI won't expect everyone like the movie as I did, because it is not made for everyone. But you could try it and then decide your thought on this film. That is one of the way the movies like this can work for the people who are choosy sometimes.\r\n\r\n8/10"

However, the directing goes wrong from the very beginning with the going back in time to show how we got here trick, and the voice over, narration. From there it just got worst. The acting/characters are bad, the story gets lost in it self, and the twists don't add anything to the movie.\r\n\r\nI can't see how this is good entertainment. They could have done to the spy genre what Shaun of the Dead did to the zombie genre."

It tells the story of a University linguistics professor (Moore) as she is diagnosed a rare form of Auzheimer's disease.\r\n\r\nRichard Glatzer's direction of the movie can be viewed as a parallel to his own life and personal struggle as he lived with ALS disease. 'Still Alice' is full of emotive shots as the characters show care and support to Moore as she tries to continue juggling her career and family life with the disease. Aspects such as the music and cinematography is given a very straight-forward approach to allow the actors' performances to tell the story and to add a true to life direction.\r\n\r\nBased on the novel of the same name written by Lisa Genova, the screenplay is very faithfully adapted. The film really focuses on the story and the dialogue between the characters and some scenes and interactions are extremely moving thanks to how well it is written.\r\n\r\nJulianne Moore is perfect as the main character. She portrays her struggle with the disease with so much inner strength and dignity. Moore is supported by a solid cast such as Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart but are outshone by her brilliant performance.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Still Alice' is a very good film. It is very touching and moving tale about coping with such a life changing and destructive disease. However, it seems to only be memorable due to Julianne Moore's incredible acting.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd"

There is a fight between two groups in a college and the new principal, who wants to put an end to this, goes to meet the elder brother of one of the parties involved in the scuffle. And, there, we see that the brother himself is a ruffian, who will feed people before beating them as he wants them to be strong to take the blows. But since this person is also the hero of the film, he is what we could call a genial rowdy, and the scene plays out mostly for laughs. The district collector, who is his friend, is present at the scene, happily requesting a similar \"entertainment\" the next day as well. If this is what your of idea of fun is, then, hop on aboard, the director seems to say.\r\n\r\nThe film is a template masala film \u2014 a superhuman hero, his cronies who will sing his praises all the time, a beautiful-looking heroine, a raging villain. It has no room for logic, moving from one hero-worshipping scene to the next and is aimed at our visceral tastes. The story is in service of its star and, it is unapologetic about it.\r\n\r\nThe plot, which kicks in only in the second half, and revolves around Vinayagam (Ajith) and his four brothers, who are do-gooders who will not hesitate to meet violence with violence. Vinayagam falls in love with Koperundevi ( Tamannaah), the daughter of Nallasivam ( Nasser), a pacifist. He tries to mend his ways for the sake of his lover, but when he learns that a revenge-seeking convict (Atul Kulkarni) wants to annihilate her entire family, he decides to stop him at all cost.\r\n\r\nThe very purpose of Veeram is to be a showcase for its star, Ajith, and that it does quite well. Right from the hero introduction scene, Siva creates moments specifically designed for his hero to shine \u2014 you see him being praised by those around him, mouthing punch dialogues, being nice to kids and elders, fighting on a running train, and in the climax, coming back from the dead to destroy the villain and his men. The best scene among the lot is one where Vinayagam goes to meet Vanangamudi, a goon with whom he has had a few run-ins, and orders him to do his bidding, all the while making it seem like he is begging for mercy, for the sake of the peace-loving Nallasivam. And, Ajith effortlessly conveys the heroic nature of his character and completely plays to the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe challenge with this sort of film is that it should keep moving forward without losing momentum. And that is where Veeram slips, at least in the initial stages. The entire first half involves the shenanigans of Vinayagam's brothers who, with help from their lawyer Bail Perumal ( Santhanam) try to get their brother fall in love with Koperundevi. Throughout these episodes, we are left wondering where the plot is heading and the film doesn't make it clear even by the interval point. The brothers too are uniformly uninteresting \u2014 all the four of them look the same and behave the same, and their characters are hardly defined. The romantic portions and Santhanam's quips, while entertaining, travel through previously trodden ground.\r\n\r\nAs for the second half, it coasts along once the plot kicks in and for a while, we are engrossed in Vinayagam's efforts to track down the various teams of hitmen sent to wipe out Koperundevi's family. But, even here, the villain doesn't come across as too much of a challenger to the hero, and, despite having an actor like Atul Kulkarni, Siva fails to build a truly terrifying character."

So he fought for his theory against the NFL who was denying it. I was neutral when #OscarsSoWhite broke out, but for this movie I definitely agree on that. Whether he would have won or not, Will Smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.\r\n\r\nThat's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the Academy chose a wrong side to stand. Felt like they are supporting NFL instead of fact and its own product. This biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause CTE as must as this one. Since Dr. Omalu's research came from NFL players, so it was all about between them.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful movie, I was very surprised for it. In the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. I hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. No need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. This is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. I think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to Ridley Scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.\r\n\r\n9/10"

There seems to be a rut that has emerged where this new brand of horror film makers can't see that recycling the same ideas is, well, kinda dull.\r\n\r\nInsidious, Dead Silence and The Conjuring have their critics (not me, I like them all very much), but the timing was right for them to hit the mark of many a horror film lover. Tapping into the fear of the doll and the demon hadn't been done for some time, certainly not with any conviction, so all good there for the fans.\r\n\r\nAnnabelle spins off from The Conjuring, and Dead Silence to a degree, but just comes off as a lazy cash-cow. The doll is a spooky monstrosity (most unlike the real Rag-Dolly-Anna version), but it's all a bit of a con, the makers resorting to another demonic being, only Red Darth Maul has now been replaced by Blue Lagoon The Loon.\r\n\r\nCharacter's actions are often preposterous, stretching credulity to breaking point (I know you are being menaced by the unknown, but I got a conference to go to, sleep tight babe!). Elsewhere, while everyone acknowledges that what scares you is subjective, but the scares here are very thin on the ground, not helped by a dull script and bland lead actors.\r\n\r\nIt's tidy enough a production, granted, but familiarity breeds contempt and it's hoped that Wan's return to the director's chair for The Conjuring 2 (where we revisit the realm of poltergeist activity), signals a return to form for his horror stable. 5/10"

There appeared in front of him named Sewashi, Nobita's descendant of four generations later from the 22nd century, and Doraemon, a 22nd century cat-type caretaker robot who helps people with its secret gadgets. Sewashi claims that his family is suffering from the debts Nobita made even to his generation, so in order to change this disastrous future, he brought along Doraemon as Nobita's caretaker to bring happiness to his future, although Doraemon is not happy about this. And so Sewashi installed an accomplishment program into Doraemon forcing him to take care of Nobita. Unless he makes Nobita happy, Doraemon can no longer go back to the 22nd century. This is how the life of Doraemon and Nobita begins. Will Doraemon succeed this mission and return to the 22nd century?",

            "review": "> No gadget can edit the future, only hard work does.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I am not a Doraemon fan, I did not grow up watching the series. I was hooked up to the Cartoon Network and its all the shows. But this one, they never aired it, so I am not familiar with. However, I had a few glimpses while passing by when my niece watching it on the television set. She loves it and she draws it. It was an English dubbed version though, that did not excite me a much. Officially, this movie was my first encounter with this what millions of children love, Doraemon. I really, really liked it, almost loved it. Feel regret that I should have known it before the movie because it was so good like those I'd enjoyed in my childhood days.\r\n\r\n3D anime is a new market. It is an easy production compared to 2D animation where digital 3D is an optional advantage. That does not mean the regular Anime is losing its trade, but recent Studio Ghibli's decision to halt in production makes suspicious. Look, what has 3D animation done in Hollywood, a rapid growth in last ten years shrunk the 2D animations. The last film I remember I saw was 'The Princess and the Frog'. On one side, I am delighted because we are advancing, but in another it is very sad that Cartoons are losing its honour. The bright side is, all those flat characters we loved in our days are reshaping in the 3D avatar. The great successful example is the latest 'Asterix and Obelix' movie. 'Popeye' and many other films are too in the line, so something to cheer!\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all I did not know Doraemon is a science-fiction, in fact, I thought Doraemon is some kind of talking toy, like in the movie 'Ted'. Fans, don't mind, I am just a beginner, but quickly learning. The only criticism I heard so far from the Doraemon fans was that the story was not new, they have already seen it in the anime short version. This film was not a follow-up to any earlier films are TV series. It was a fresh beginning like from the scratch that really helped me to understand and would do same for anyone who are unfamiliar with this. It was based on the six Doraemon manga short stories. You would easily find splits between those parts while changing the phases, but overall, a fine assembles.\r\n\r\nUnlike television series, this Japanese Academy Award winner for Animated movie is for all. That mean adults as well can enjoy it besides the kids. There are many special things about the movie. Obviously it is very humorous, but unexpectedly so romantic and emotional with the matured materials used to tell the tale, even for the kids it is something to learn from. I loved many individual scenes, because those were not just beautiful and funny, but very clever indeed. Especially the end twist makes 'what the heck!', yet simple charmingly smart. Instantly I became the Doraemon fan, and now I want a sequel.\r\n\r\n> It's hard saying goodbye. But...\r\n> It's harder thinking that I'll be making her unhappy. \r\n\r\nThe character Nobita was just like the one from 'CJ7' who is obsessed with his new beneficial friend. Because he is not good at anything, sometimes he begins well, but ends it in a disaster, so he always depended on the gadgets from his beloved robot cat. Besides, he's lazy and always get bullied by his classmates Gian and Suneo. But he do has a crush on a girl called Shizuka, a brainy student Hidetoshi stands between him and her. Now he has a competitor and to win her heart, which as well helps to fix his future, whatsoever he must work hard. Those efforts are pleasantly illustrated in the movie.\r\n\r\nI liked all the 3D converted characters, especially Shizuka was so cute. Doraemon looked little bigger and like a giant blue ball, in a nice, funny, acceptable way. The same energy was maintained from the anime, like the law of gravity is not applicable. Such as in situations when someone jumps in the air, he stays there for a while when he/she was in joy or shocked and tears drip sidewards. That's the difference between 2D and 3D animations, but it worked well in this film. After all, that's why the animations are for, making impossible to possible. Animals can talk and they can be our (generally children) hero. I enjoyed it as much any kid does. This movie is a revolution in Doraemon's history, an opportunity to get in to meet these adorable characters in the beginning itself if you're alien to this. I know Doraemon fans love it, hope others as well do the same.\r\n\r\n7.5/10"

            "review": "As likened to an innocuous fairy tale rash, the movie mythology surrounding J.M. Barrie\u2019s classical kiddie character \u201cPeter Pan\u201d comes and goes when it pleases. Naturally there have been several big screen interpretations to outlast one\u2019s reserved stash of pixie dust to fling around. From perhaps the best known animated film adaptation of Walt Disney\u2019s nostalgically revered version to the surprisingly big-budgeted Steven Spielberg-directed spectacle dud Hook with a high-caliber cast the legend of \u201cThe Boy That Never Grew Up\u201d seems to spark the challenge of presenting yet another spin on Barrie\u2019s iconic treasured tyke.\r\n\r\nIn director Joe Wright\u2019s sci-fi fantasy action-adventure Pan the familiar factors of Barrie\u2019s magical Boy Wonder are evident and should serve as a mild and manufactured revisit to the \u201cPeter Pan\u201d folklore for children of all ages. However, the whimsical aspect of Pan was dubiously overshadowed, overproduced yet curiously understated in its ability to convey a storytelling moment that did not seem laborious. Consequently, Pan feels mechanical and never quite settles in with any sense of breezy charm or youthful balance of wonderment. Instead, the audience is left wondering about the uniqueness and distinctive approach to an already ubiquitous serving of Barrie\u2019s celebrated literary lad. Despite the vibrant visuals and the given big screen blueprint for \u201cPeter Pan\u2019s\u201d endearing legacy Wright\u2019s toothless tale of flashy action and adventure may just prove to be another proverbial flash in the Pan. \r\n\r\nClearly, there is no rhyme or rhythm to tamper with the built-in concept of what the majestic make-up for \u201cPeter Pan\u201d should be conceived in the minds of generations that were subjected to Barrie\u2019s boundless boy. Still, Wright and Jason Fuchs fail to capture any fresh imagination or intrigue about the puppy dog-eyed youngster\u2019s on-screen by-the-dots adventures. This pumped-up project is pedestrian at best and nothing more than another sparkled rung in the \u201cPeter Pan\u201d ladder of box office hits-and-misses. The casting for Pan is decent enough but the shoddy material they are left to elevate with their included presence is wasted in a stillborn fantasy odyssey that cannot overcome its own creative indifference.\r\n\r\nPan seeks to start out with its own embedded twist by delivering this narrative as a prequel set in 1940\u2019s London. Here, we are introduced to 12-year old Peter (Levi Miller) whose disillusionment continues to spiral while staying at the chaotic Catholic orphanage he was unceremoniously dumped off courtesy of his desperate mother (Amanda Seyfried). Nevertheless, Peter maintains some semblance of hope that his mother will soon return to fetch him and all should solve whatever abandonment issues he has at hand.\r\n\r\nSoon, Peter and his fellow orphanage buddies will succumb to the clutches of Blackbeard the Pirate (Hugh Jackman). Evidently bad boy Blackbeard had been a notorious busy beaver by sadistically kidnapping working class children and shipping them off to his Neverland mines to toil there. However, Blackbeard and his bunch cannot be too bad to tolerate since they welcome out-of-the-blue snappy sing-a-longs to such noteworthy tunes as Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d and the Romones\u2019 \u201cBiltzkrieg Bop\u201d. Huh? Of course this impromptu musical sequence is not the only thing that seems curiously out of place in the disjointed Pan. \r\n\r\nOkay...so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?\r\nOkay\u2026so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?\r\nIt is not long before the plagued Peter meets and becomes attached to a hustling drifter named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). Yes folks\u2026it appears that Star Wars comparisons are in order here as Peter\u2019s Luke Skywalker teams with shifty Hook\u2019s Han Solo to defeat the devilish Blackbeard\u2019s Darth Vader. And you might want to ask who is the Princess Leia in this disguised Star Wars premise amid the mines and high seas? Well, in this case Princess Leia is in the form of Pan\u2019s Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Thus, the gang assembles together in an attempt to thwart the iron fist of Darth Vader\u2026er, the diabolical Blackbeard. The excitable exploits of the crew coming together to defeat the pesky pirate is meshed together with the flashy flourishes of random 3-D special effects, the vitality of color and scope and playful variations of well-known \u201cPeter Pan\u201d personalities. Hence, all the festive and feisty flexing that Pan demonstrates still cannot compensate for a lackluster execution of Wright\u2019s anemic installment that botches a ready-made backstory for \u201cPeter Pan\u201d enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAs Peter, Miller shows some solid and impish promise as the boy searching for self-discovery in a bizarre surrounding of despair and disappointment. Jackman\u2019s over-the-top villainous Blackbeard is simply passable but nothing really worth hanging your hat on. Jackman\u2019s plotting pirate will not make anyone dismiss Johnny Depp\u2019s Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies anytime soon. The added elements in supporting players such as Hedlund\u2019s Hook and Mara\u2019s Tiger Lily (not to mention the Lost Boys) feel synthetic and arbitrary\u2013something not very encouraging as these characterizations are essential to the whole \u201cPeter Pan\u201d universe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Pan one might end up saying never mind to the boisterous yet aimless shenanigans situated in Neverland.\r\n\r\nPan (2015)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n1 hr. 51 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Levi Miller, Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara, Amanda Seyfried\r\n\r\nDirected by: Joe Wright\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi Fantasy and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
