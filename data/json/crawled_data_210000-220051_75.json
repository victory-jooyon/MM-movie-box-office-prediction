            "review": "***Haunting Mystery with Supernatural Elements \u2013 Reverent, Beautiful, Brilliant***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Mark Pellington, \"The Mothman Prophecies\" details some of the strange events that occurred in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, from November 15, 1966, to December 15, 1967 (13 months). The movie, however, transplants the events to the year 2001.\r\n\r\nPLOT: Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife, Mary (Debra Messing). He mysteriously shows up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where he develops a relationship with the sympathetic police sergeant, Connie (Laura Linney). Many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie mothman-like entity, similar to the one Mary saw before she died. A researcher (Alan Bates) believes that the \u2018mothmen\u2019 exist on a sphere beyond human comprehension and that they can foresee impending calamities. Is the \u2018mothman\u2019 sighted in Point Pleasant warning the citizens of one? If so, what is it?\r\n\r\nThis is not a monster movie or a slasher horror flick; if you want that see \u201cMothman\u201d (2010), which is actually pretty good for a TV creature feature (and interestingly links the mothman to the unjust slaying of Cornstalk, aka Hokoleskwa, in 1777). \u201cThe Mothman Prophecies,\u201d by contrast, is a supernatural/mystery story with cogent creepy mood. Every element skillfully works: acting, story, editing, score, cinematography, locations, effects, etc. Underneath the film\u2019s eeriness there\u2019s an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality while the ending is strangely touching.\r\n\r\nOne critic claimed that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. But this is untrue. The film is intricate and respects the intelligence of the viewer. Questions are raised with varying possibilities. The answers are there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have \"ears to hear\" and be willing to work for them.\r\n\r\nMy initial interpretation was that the \u2018mothmen\u2019 are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humanity by predicting great calamities but can be misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell, my interpretation was that the mothman somehow brought Klein to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the mothmen are good in nature.\r\n\r\nI've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: \"The Mothman Prophecies\" is a rare film that\u2019s genuinely intriguing and filled with gems to mine, even if you\u2019ve already seen it several times. It\u2019s so artistic that it\u2019s a pleasure to behold over and over.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in Kittanning, Pennsylvania (substituting for Point Pleasant), Pittsburgh (the factory and city scenes, etc.) and other Western PA towns. WRITERS: Richard Hatem wrote the screenplay from John Keel\u2019s book.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A\r\n\r\nINSIGHTS ABOUT THE MOTHMEN *** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don\u2019t read until you view the movie).\r\n\r\nThe \u2018mothmen\u2019 are evil spirits or fallen angels (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures, which never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather dark disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. It\u2019s the same thing with the actual appearances of the creature (freeze frame the images).\r\n\r\nA mothman CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?\r\n\r\nThe bible calls Satan the \"prince of the power of the air;\" hence, his filthy underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus speak through a phone that's not plugged in or perhaps manipulate a traffic light. They can mimic the voices of dead loved ones or even take human form, like Indrid Cold, Mary or the male nurse who insists that Mary's drawings are of \"angels\" and then mysteriously vanishes.\r\n\r\nThe researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from \u201chell\u201d (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin people\u2019s lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human suffering (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family, career & respectable social life). Also, they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.\r\n\r\nThe reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for millennia and therefore see things 2-3 moves ahead of humans; they use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. Since their M.O. is to \u201ckill, steal and destroy,\u201d they feed on death, destruction and torment and therefore venture to the places where great tragedies will transpire, like the Silver Bridge collapse.\r\n\r\nThe saved police woman at the end was number \"37,\u201d historically a numerical symbol of The Christ, which shows that her submersion in the river and figurative resurrection is a type of the Anointed One. Yet she is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are destructive and manipulative could now flip-flop into the deception that they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Klein and Connie in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.\r\n\r\nThe film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are malevolent beings who purpose to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal or lead to great suffering. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with the Creator through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement and utilizing the armor of light."

All the former are good, each one with differing personalities. None of the voice cast standout majorly but they all fit perfectly and work together nicely. I rate the music used, also.\r\n\r\nA simple yet effective film, one that you'll rate if you find the TV episodes entertaining."

Now a married-with-children high-school chemistry teacher and baseball coach in Texas, Jim's team makes a deal with him: if they win the district championship, Jim will try out with a major-league organization. The bet proves incentive enough for the team, and they go from worst to first, making it to state for the first time in the history of the school. Jim, forced to live up to his end of the deal, is nearly laughed off the try-out field--until he gets onto the mound, where he confounds the scouts (and himself) by clocking successive 98 mph fastballs, good enough for a minor-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Jim's still got a lot of pitches to throw before he makes it to The Show, but with his big-league dreams revived, there's no telling where he could go.",

It portrays, with extra drama I'm sure, the events of Morris' real life baseball career in a fantastic way. There's great character development right from the get-go, by the conclusion I was utterly invested in Morris. He is played by Dennis Quaid, who is superb in the role. I felt every emotion of his character, best I've (currently) seen of Quaid so far.\r\n\r\nThe film does a great job at making you care for not only him, but even his high school team. Speaking of which, they did a terrific job with the casting of those guys - I felt like I was watching a bunch of real teammates; Chad Lindberg, of <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em>, is one of them. Even away from Quaid and Lindberg & Co., you still have Morris' family to feel for as well. There's many characters to get attached to, but I was very interested in all of them.\r\n\r\nFantastic stuff, I'd highly recommend you watch <em>'The Rookie'</em>."

            "review": "This is the movie he made after Jackie Brown. I thought I might just point that out. A big budget, larger scale action blockbuster. This is the one that would change the direction of Tarantino's films. And honestly, it might be my favorite besides Pulp Fiction.\r\n\r\nThis movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action. This movie has an anime section akin to Japanese anime. That's some cool stuff. Even the non-action parts are some really good stuff. Like the guy from the old Street Fighter movies as Hatori Hanzo and making the Bride's sword. And the fantastic soundtrack. The great opening scene where the Bride gets shot and then the somber \"Bang Bang\" by Nancy Sinatra plays. \r\n\r\nBut of course, the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie. A lot of it is showcased in the Crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it. It has some brilliant uses of the style. Of course, there's black and white which was actually used to avoid an NC-17, but works very effectively. And the beautifully shot battle between the Bride and O-Ren. No music really adds a lot to it. It's quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the Crazy 88. \r\n\r\nBut there's also the opening hand to hand fight scene with Vernita Green which is also very well edited. Very surprising scene as it is interrupted by Green's daughter coming home and then they talk. And it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to Vernita's chest. What a brilliant tension filled scene.\r\n\r\nThe movie also never takes itself too seriously. That's for the sequel. But the fun action and style leads the whole way. Also along with Buck, and other fun scenes. Lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as Elle Driver comes to kill the Bride in her sleep. Or interrogating Sophie. \"These will be things you will miss.\" I love it.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it might be the best action movie of the 2000s, at least for me. And Tarantino has a lot of my favorite movies. Maybe I enjoy his movies a bit too much. But even with that, it's one of the my favorites. Kill Bill Vol 1 gets a 10/10"

On the train home from Chauncey Academy for the Thanksgiving weekend, Oscar confides in his best friend that he has plans for this vacation--he will win the heart of his true love. But there is one major problem--Oscar's true love is his stepmother Eve. Oscar is certain that he could be a better mate to Eve than his work-obsessed father. He fails to win Eve's heart and is consequently dejected. Oscar's path to his true love is further crossed by Diane, Eve's best friend who, one night while wearing Eve's borrowed perfumed scarf, offers him temporary comfort in an unconventional tryst. For Diane, Oscar fills a void in her life. For Oscar, Diane is somewhat of a distraction, as his continued pursuit of Eve leads to an unexpected resolution.",

Can the odd ball inhabitants of this Arizona town escape with their lives? Or will spiders rule the earth and lay waste to man kind?\r\n\r\nEight Legged Freaks is unashamedly homaging B movie creature features from the 1950s. The likes of Tarantula and Them! have their Pedipalps well and truly watered, in what is possibly the most undervalued of all the modern day creature feature homages. Having no pretensions what so ever, the only real thing not in \"Freaks\" favour is the usage of CGI, but even that doesn't hurt the film, if anything it adds to the obvious preposterous nature of the genre. I mean how else are we to get 20 foot jumping spiders chowing down on some annoying teenager?\r\n\r\nPerhaps \"Freaks\" is viewed harsh because the cast is relatively C list? Again that is a genre staple, surely? For what it's worth I think they do real fine, David Arquette has oodles of goofy charisma, Kari Wuher makes a fine female ass kicker, and the kids (one a young Scarlett Johansen) are really rather cool. Director Ellory Elkayem, who after doing They Nest in 2000 clearly has bug issues, adheres to genre staples. Kooky western town out in the desert, the inhabitants of which range from near loonies to dopey politicians, and the plot follows the traditional sense of impending doom played for laughs. Listen out for the score from John Ottman, which plays on variants of \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\", whilst cast a keen eye on John S. Bartley's Arizona camera work.\r\n\r\nWhilst not having the savvy scripting of homage daddy, Tremors, or the star appeal of 1990's Arachnophobia, Eight Legged Freaks deserves its place amongst such fun and creepy company. As the tag line says, \"Do you hate spiders? Do you really hate spiders? Well they don't like you either\". With that, I think it's web well and truly spun, don't you? 7/10"

            "review": "Probably the best movie of 2002 that nobody actually saw. A hard-hitting, realistic look at the undercover police world with a bitter taste of the cases that they work. Jason Patric and Ray Liotia play the parts of two Detroit police offers tasked with bringing the killers of a fellow undercover officer to justice.\r\n\r\nDark, gritty and overwhelming, Narc doesn't sugarcoat law enforcement but somehow keeps the experience real without turning the opinion of the viewer against the officers, who often bend the rules as far as they can without going over the edge.\r\n\r\nExcellent drama, along with some very realistic dialog and some top-notch acting brings this title to the forefront of its niche. I guarantee you won't figure out \"who done it\" until the very end. Definitely not a date night movie, or something to watch while the kids are around, but something perfect for a rainy afternoon flick with the guys."

There's also an iffy love story in there, while the attempted message is a little blurred by the end. It feels like they created a funny short story and turned it into a feature length, without much thought.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this, fair enough. For me, however, <em>'Max Keeble's Big Move'</em> is awful."

She apprehends a job as a secretary to a quirky, arduous lawyer (James Spader) wherein their employer-employee bond turns increasingly sexual in a dominant/submissive way.\r\n\r\nThis is the first mainline film in America to breach the difficult topic of BDSM, walking the balance beam between being either too amusing or too offensive. For those not in the know, BDSM is an overlap of acronyms: BD stands for Bondage and Discipline; DS for Dominance and Submission; and SM for Sadism and Masochism. I didn\u2019t really know the movie tackled BDSM before viewing it; I thought it was simply a romance-in-the-office type flick with maybe some kinky elements. \r\n\r\nThe movie is polarizing, unsurprisingly. I read a few reviews by respectable critics and one was fascinated by it, giving it an incredible 10/10 Stars (Why Sure!), while another wrote it off as a film for sick people, granting it 1/10 Stars. Whilst I find the romance-at-the-office element interesting, I could care less about the BDSM angle. Regardless, the first half is amusing enough and Maggie is a winsome treat, but the second half gets a little too deviant and borders on porn. \r\n\r\nYet the movie ends well with a well-intentioned message: This is a story about two people who have an affinity for DS that find each other and their relationship may or may not work (no spoilers). I suppose the movie is trying to get across that pain can be therapeutic as long as it's applied by the right hand with the right intention. Thus two people with an affinity for BDSM can develop a relationship that works, for them. But not me; no thanks.                                       \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITERS: Mary Gaitskill (short story) and Erin Cressida Wilson & Shainberg (screenplay).  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C-"

For what I can recall as I vaguely remember it, the story was all over the place, actually it was more like a film about \"nothing\". You got these 3 friends (Britney included) going on a road trip together (I know I'm just reading off from the plot lines here) and then they come across this guy who is your typical handsome guy at which point is where the film becomes a load of nonsense with nothing interesting happening, this is where the film pretty much gives up trying to be a movie and goes into soap opera territory but is worse.\r\n\r\nWhat I actually find most baffling is that this film is supposed to be a \"romantic comedy\" film yet there was nothing in this film that was remotely funny. And Britney Spears thought she could have a good crack at movie acting, huh, I don't think so.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't remember everything from the film since it was years ago since I last saw the film, but then again why would you want to remember an awful movie like this? Really bad movies such as this are best left buried away from the mind to be made forgotten forever."

This is a beautifully animated film, one of the best Disney has ever put out. Stitch has become something of a pop culture icon. Much like Jack Skellington and Bart Simpson, Stitch has struck an emotional chord with audiences. Aside from him being adorable, it also must have something to do with how Stitch, a being created to destroy, ends up being the missing link that brings a broken family together. There are times that Lilo & Stitch touches on dark subject matter. Lilo reminds me of many problem children that were misunderstood by parents, kids, and the system. But by the end, Lilo & Stitch will have you smiling by bringing you into a very happy place."

That's if you didn't already guess from the poster.\r\n\r\nAs always I try to find the positive parts: ... ... Yeah. If I was forced to pick something, it would be one or two of the songs which are not horrid; there's also a notable cameo from an English musician, I guess that's one? As you can tell, it's not good at all.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, where to start with the negatives?! The bears. Having people in costumes is always a bad idea, it cheapens everything else around it. They have little or no emotion, so it's impossible to feel attached to the characters. The dub-like audio for them, and other parts of film, is very poor.\r\n\r\nNo-one stands out in the cast, with the exception of Christopher Walken (Reed) - but that's only because of Walken's fame, not his role in this. The premise is so predictable and lazy, they don't even attempt to throw you off the scent - instead trying to force a heartwarming story, which doesn't land whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI, no matter what, always feel 1* is harsh, but this deserves it. Of the 1,106 films I've currently seen, this is just the fifth time a film has scored this low with me. Truly dreadful."

            "review": "It didn't kill me softly. \r\n \r\nWill is self centered and has cast off all his responsibilities. But during one of his more dubious scams to date single mothers, he is forced to reconsider his moral fibre after coming into contact with a 12 year old outcast named Marcus.\r\n\r\nAdapted from the massively popular book written by Nick Hornby (\"Fever Pitch\" & \"High Fidelity\") About A Boy easily translates well to the screen without truly breaking free of the modest premise. Oddly enough for such a British picture, this is directed by an American, Paul Weitz, who along with his brother Chris, brought the world \"American Pie\". It works, largely to the undervalued comic talents of one Hugh Grant (Will). I would go so far as to say that without Grant leading the film, this would have been a flop, all the highlights on offer are when Grant is on the screen. Expressive with his face and delivering his lines with a natural high, Grant nicely lures the audience into the less than admirable Will's hands. Which is quite a trick considering that Will is a morally dubious scum bag!.\r\n\r\nNicholas Hoult (Marcus) is OK as child actors go, but here he is given far to much to do. Which is another reason why Grant is so important to the film being a success, he shoulders much of the emotional burden, letting Hoult breathe what life he can into poor young Marcus (worst hair cut on film ever). Solid support comes from Toni Collette and Rachael Weisz, and Weitz's direction is smooth and unobtrusive, with Badly Drawn Boy's score an integral part of the story. Yet as much as I enjoy the film myself, one still feels frustrated that it didn't turn out better than it did. A double handed narration from both lead characters intrudes on the flow of the plot, and the pay off is ultimately an \"oh\" moment. So to me it's an OK movie made into a good one courtesy of one of Britain's best light comedy actors. 7/10"

And if they're lapping up their own vomit, the only way to stop them is with a lash. \r\n\r\nA sparse soundstage is stylishly utilized to create a minimalist small-town setting in which a mysterious woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) hides from the criminals who pursue her. The town locals at first decide to shield Grace, and in return she openly works labour tasks for them to work off her gratitude. It's not long, however, before the residents of Dogville begin to show their true teeth...\r\n\r\nOne thing is an absolute, Lars Von Trier knows how to push the buttons of critics and movie lovers alike. Dogville proved to be a case in point, a film that saw some high profile film critics renounce the director as anti American - even anti human, while others lauded the \"Great Dane\" as a visionary and a director of bravura panache. The point is, and it's a fact, there is no guarantee that Dogville will hit the spot of every first time viewer venturing in for the challenge.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, I'm very much in the plus camp here, to me it's not only brave in style of production, but also it's narratively as caustic as anything so called \"anti human\" directors like Kubrick, Godard etc ever produced. The bareness of the sound stage setting, where we can see the workings of all residents of Dogville going about their respective business, very much shows there is no hiding place, all the bile strewn movements/ignorance is laid bare for all to see, we are all complicit.\r\n\r\nThere's an outstanding cast assembled, fronted by Kidman (never more beautiful and never better as an actress), with support coming from Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Philip Baker Hall and others who give their all for their director. It's often charged that Trier is a misogynist, personally I don't see it that way, more so as Dogville reaches its crushing climax. This easily could have been shaved of 20 minutes from the run time, but it has to be said that Von Trier doesn't waste a single frame here.\r\n\r\nRoll your dice and take your chance, you will either love it or hate it, or admire or admonish, what isn't in doubt is that you will never ever forget watching Dogville. 9/10"

Sean Penn plays the role of his life and he is way more impressive than Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\". And that performance already can be considered flawless. Also very impressive is little Dakota Fanning in her role as Lucy and one of the best child performances ever brought to screen. And even after the movie is over it will stay with you for a long time and will get you thinking on what side you would actually be if this case would be happening around you. Would you ignore all logic and just decide by your heart or does the common sense weigh strong enough to side with the court and child services pointing out that little Lucy needs a secure surrounding with capable parents who can provide security and mature advice? Anyhow, this movie is incredible and I wouldn't change a single thing."

That doesn't stop it from being crass in the worst possible way, or completely uncomfortable. Or completely unoriginal... although I guess you could argue that part is by necessity... Look, what I'm saying is, credit where credit's due. It's like, fuck _Transformers_, what a garbage bunch of films those are, but at the same time, it's hard to knock a billion dollar gross earning.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal_."

Reggie Wright (Epps) is a slippery con artist who is avoiding the law, and Jackson. During a cat and mouse chase, the two stumble on a multi-million dollar diamond heist. Hiding from Jackson, Wright finds himself in the thieves' getaway van and ends up having to escape from them after they discover their booty is fake, much to the displeasure of their ruthless boss (Flanagan). When Wright meets up with his girlfriend (Mendes), he discovers that his recently purchased lottery ticket is the sole winner of $60 million. Unfortunately, his wallet, which held the ticket, was left in the thieves' van, so he persuades Jackson to help him get it back.",

            "review": "Definitely not Nolan's best but probably my favourite (at least tied with 'Batman Begins') because I love the Norwegian original so much AND the subtle changes Nolan made with it, as well as what the three stars (Al Pacino, Robin Williams--in his first villainous role, I believe, and Hilary Swank--in probably my favourite performance of hers, next to the downright decadence and naughtiness she displayed in 'The Black Dahlia') bring to the table here. I greatly enjoyed the five short extras on my DVD (a double-sided disc I bought years ago that has 'The Devil's Advocate' on the other side, yet unwatched): a conversation/interview of Nolan with Pacino; 'Day for Night: The Making of...'; 'In the Fog' (which interviewed cinematographer Wally Pfister); Nathan Crowley: production designer; and 'Eyes Wide Open' (which interviewed sleep disturbance experts), which thankfully I viewed before I watched the movie, to enhance my experience.\r\n\r\nGreatly recommended to fans of contemporary crime thrillers, regardless of whether you watched the Norwegian original or not. There are enough differences to still make it worth your while as a cinephile."

Seeing as how Patrick has managed to get to all the other witnesses, Reuven is so desperate to keep Shimon alive that he assigns himself to watch-duty, with the intention of never letting Shimon out of his sight. But as the trial draws near, events start spinning out of control when, in an act of desperation, Reuven sends his sexually frustrated mistress, Aya, to plant a bug in Patrick's apartment. Encouraged by Patrick's neighbor, Aya decides to confront Reuven about his sexual inadequacy and his vain promises to her about leaving his wife, just as Patrick slips out of house-arrest. Will Reuven be able to keep his mind on the job while his love life melts down in front of his eyes?",

Jane and Wendy seem to have the most detail put into their animation.  The (classic) crocodile was replaced with an octopus (but still includes a suction cup version of tik-toking) by a visual director that barely understood what an octopus was.\r\n\r\nNow, being that I'm generally opposed to the octopus in general, I happen to know a few things about octopus so giving it snail-like eyes, a beak AND teeth, as well as an over-sized tongue broke me a little.  The behaviors were typically way off, to include swimming with it's arms above water (they typically help with the locomotion) and some weird physics when climbing the boat.\r\n\r\nAlso, we've pretty much pinpointed the inspiration for Neverland Island, which does actually include salt water crocodiles, but as it is in the Caribbean, this Giant Pacific Octopus  is completely out of place.\r\n\r\nThe animation style was also shifting from scene to scene, object to object.  Sometimes it is very jarring, a digital cell character atop a cg rendered log, or other times it's a cg rendered background against the digital cell animation of the ship (or vice versa) that really took me out of it as it just looked so unnatural.  I'll site \"Titan A.E.\" (Fox) and \"Treasure Planet\" (Disney) as too different examples where it was blended much more smoothly.\r\n\r\nI actually like the premise better: Hook kidnap's Wendy's daughter, but the movie does so many weird things.  Even though the original movie was officially set in the 1950s, Wendy grows at least 4-6 years to 18 to have a 12 year old daughter and a (generously) 3 year old boy, but the entire world travels backwards to WW2.  Even if we retro the original setting, make Wendy....30?, that means the original occurred in 1929 at the latest, as this sequel could occur during 1945 at the latest, and I just did more math than I'm comfortable with to enjoy a movie.\r\n\r\nAnd this bad movie has the audacity to drop like real dilemmas in the middle: obligation to family vs trustworthiness, acceptance of others, and this crazy mechanical suggestion about how The Fey of the island work.  Does belief of faeries / pixies matter, is it disbelief that actually harms them?\r\n\r\nLook, this isn't the worst thing to watch, but I honestly kind of regret my time spent on it."
