She sees again in her mind's eye that other Jonathan as as he'd materialised on the street - sees again the way he merely glanced at her, unseeing, uninterested, as he passed her by. As if they didn't know each other and were not lovers and of course they didn't know each other, were not lovers...Molly recalls speaking his name as if it were a magic talisman that might make things right: Jonathan. But the man's name was James._\r\n\r\n- Joyce Carol Oates; _Lives o__f the Twins_ (1987)\r\n\r\nFrom prolific French auteur Fran\u00e7ois Ozon (_Sous le sable_; _8 femmes_; _Frantz_), _L'amant double_ [_Double Lover_] is partly a study of sexual obsession, partly an oneiric mystery (think Neil Jordan's _In Dreams_), and partly a conventional thriller (more whoisit than whodunnit). \"Freely adapted\" from Joyce Carol Oates's 1987 novel _Lives of the Twins_ (published under the pseudonym Rosamond Smith), and written by Ozon and Philippe Piazzo, the film tells the story of Chlo\u00e9 (Marine Vacth), a woman with a fragile mental state, who falls passionately in love with her psychoanalyst, Paul (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier). Within a few months, she has moved in, however, as time goes by, she slowly starts to learn of a significant part of his identity which he has been concealing.\r\n\r\nImagine, if you will, _Vertigo_ (1958) remade by someone like Gaspar No\u00e9 or Lars von Trier, and you'd be some way towards getting a handle on Ozon's latest; completely barmy (you know you're in strange territory when the second shot of a movie is, quite literally, an internal shot of a vagina). As one would expect from Ozon, the aesthetics are solid - the film is built upon an inventive visual style employing juxtaposition, pseudo-split screen, and copious amounts of shots with one person in the frame proper, and the person to whom they're talking only visible in reflection. The sound effects are also excellent and really jolt you out of your seat on a couple of occasions. Similarly, the acting is strong, with both Vacth and Renier unrecognisable in their respective roles.\r\n\r\nHowever, the melodramatic and self-congratulatory plot is an absolute mess. Many of Ozon's standard tropes are here; a dissection of the academic middle class/intelligentsia, an examination of the schism between appearance and reality, an attempt to elucidate the mind of a complex woman, a psychoanalytical bedrock, the mutability of identity etc. But it's all diffused through an utterly farcical narrative, which fails to get even the basics right. For example, sex is a central theme, but by the time we get to the fourth or fifth sex scene, it has completely lost its potency (compare, for example, Abdellatif Kechiche's infinitely superior _La vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2_, (2013) where sexuality is just as central, but which features only two sex scenes). The same goes for the increasingly ridiculous plot twists, once you get to three or four and you're still in the first half of the movie, you just stop caring. Ozon has always been hit and miss, for every _Sitcom_ (1998) and _Swimming Pool_ (2003), there's an _Angel_ (2007) and a _Ricky_ (2009), and _L'amant double_ is, in the end, a rather pointless film that seems to think it's saying something exceptionally profound about desire and identity. It isn't."

I don't think we need to start with the \"dead relative\" trope, I'm not a fan of putting people in the fridge, and this makes me feel like I was supposed to feel like I did in \"Up!\", but it's just not the same.  My next biggest problem was looking at a pig and hearing Mila Kunis' voice: for whatever reason it was very distracting.\r\n\r\nSo what I mean when I say more movies should copy this is the formula it uses.  It quickly does some character development and world building for one universe that introduces the other, and the re-establishes the 2nd universe with more succinct character building, a show of adversity / antagonism, some light back story, and a quest to solve a mystery, drip feeding information to the audience.\r\n\r\nHonestly, if you're making a movie you can just start at the quest and the audience will catch up, especially if you have re-iterate the situation to other characters.  It won't be as charming, but you can fit more movie in, and thus more cool, fun stuff.\r\n\r\nI love the \"chim-pan-zombies\", I think it was an excellent idea.  This is one of those \"the story if a parallel for real life\" sort of things, so of course it's about a young person dealing with their emotions of a traumatic event, but I certainly found myself forgetting about it when they stopped actively reminding me what the movie was actually about.\r\n\r\nGreat movie pick, good for the whole family, and while I acknowledge the movie isn't for me, there is a good chance it's for you."

            "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nBased on Charles Dickens' novel, The Personal History of David Copperfield is the first Armando Ianucci's film I ever watched. I didn't really know much about this movie besides its stellar cast. I'm not the biggest fan of biographical works. Usually, I find them too constricted to the genre's formulas, and if I don't think the protagonist's life is remotely entertaining, then the whole film crumbles. Fortunately, it's not the case of this Ianucci's adaptation. It's one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, I finished it with a massive smile on my face.\r\n\r\nDavid Copperfield's life is portrayed in such a captivating, entertaining, genuine, heartfelt manner, but always maintaining this sort of lightness. There's always something positive coming out of even the worst of situations. Actually, I think that's the best message transmitted to the viewer: it doesn't matter how horrible your life might be at a particular moment, it will only get better if you don't give up, and if you surround yourself with true friends and family. Throughout the runtime, David shares his life with different families and friends, working and living in the poorest and wealthiest places.\r\n\r\nHis lifestyle changes drastically after each new significant development in his journey to become a writer, and it's such a joy to watch him grow up. From working like a slave in a factory and being homeless to living in a boathouse and eventually in a mansion like a true gentleman, David goes through all of the obstacles life throws at him, learning from them to become a better person. A really nice touch is the distinct names that people call him throughout his life, depending on where he lives/works and who's he talking to: Davy, Doady, Daisy, Trotwood\u2026 These might be merely different nicknames for David, but they mean much more. They're a tiny yet efficient detail that remarkably distinguishes his unique lifestyles.\r\n\r\nIanucci and Simon Blackwell do a terrific job with the screenplay, by offering Dev Patel an exceptional platform to shine. The whole cast delivers outstanding performances that elevate the movie in an invaluable way. Patel is an excellent protagonist, and I don't want to diminish his extraordinary display, but he's only as great as his counterparts. Tilda Swinton (Betsey Trotwood) and Hugh Laurie (Mr Dick) form a hilarious couple, deeply important to help David rise from the ground. Peter Capaldi brilliantly portrays Mr Micawber, a family man with immense debts, who teaches young David (impressively represented by Jairaj Varsani) how London works by escaping his creditors.\r\n\r\nDarren Boyd and Gwendoline Christie use their physical attributes to interpret the evil Murdstone brothers, who employ extreme, violent measures to educate David. Everyone involved in bringing the Peggotty family to life is as essential as the family's importance to the protagonist. Benedict Wong (Mr Wickfield) shows his funny side once again, as Morfydd Clark is charming enough as Dora Spenlow and Clara Copperfield. Aneurin Barnard (James Steerforth) becomes David's best friend, but his final arc doesn't quite fit the film, in my opinion, prolonging the latter for a few unnecessary extra minutes.\r\n\r\nSo, as you might have figured, every cast member has a vital role to play in some shape or form. All are incredibly fun to watch, making this two-hour flick flow tremendously well. Technically, the production and costume design are award-worthy. The XIX century streets, houses, and clothes are really immersive, creating a realistic environment, elevated even more by the subtle yet powerful score (Christopher Willis). Seamless editing (Mick Audsley, Peter Lambert) and impeccable cinematography (Zac Nicholson) also help the movie's pacing and even contribute for a few transition jokes.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Personal History of David Copperfield is one of the most entertaining biographical works I've ever seen, as well as one of the most pleasant surprises of 2020. It's one of those films that leaves you with a huge smile, from ear to ear. As the viewer, watching David Copperfield's journey to becoming a writer is so captivating and fun, not only due to the humorous screenplay, but mainly because it's such an honest, emotional, genuine story. Only a few minutes in, and I already wanted him to succeed in life. My emotional attachment to the protagonist was so strong that I couldn't help myself drop a couple of tears by the end. I don't have enough words to describe how wonderful every cast member is and how important each role has in David's life. Dev Patel is an impressive lead, but his performance is elevated by the work of his counterparts. It's technically flawless, but the story and its characters make this movie an absolute delight to watch.\r\n\r\nDefinitely, one of the best films of the year, so don't you dare miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A-"

This is just one ordinary movie-goer's opinion...\r\n\r\nLovely movie. \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nI honestly wasn't expecting much, but I wanted to support MercyMe, and I always like to throw my support whenever a movie theater plays a good, clean movie like this one.\r\n\r\nI was actually quite amazed by the production. It had the look of a big budget film (I have no idea how much the budget was), and was lacking the cheese element prevalent in so many Christian movies. It was remarkably well cast, and I was particularly impressed by both guys who played Bart - the 11 year old Bart (Brody Rose), and the teenage/20something Bart (J Michael Finley). I also LOVED Trace Adkins as Brickell.\r\n\r\nI took my non-believer friend to it, because he likes MercyMe, and has enjoyed Bart's testimonies whenever I've taken him to a concert, and he liked the movie as well. He even teared up, and he is NOT an emotional guy! I cried too, but I'm an emotional girl! \ud83d\ude09\r\n\r\nI definitely recommend it. I'm not a person who enjoys going to the movie theater, and usually will only go in special circumstances. I think mainstream America playing a Christian movie in the theater is a special circumstance, and if you want to see more of this happening, I hope you'll go support it."

Whether that\u2019s a divisive plot twist, a double-faced character or even an unusual method of filming, it doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as it succeeds. Steven Knight delivers a story that doesn\u2019t feel right from the get-go. Everything feels strange and random, with weird dialogues and awkward hints at something underneath it all. Then, a somewhat predictable plot twist changes pretty much everything since our perspective is entirely different now. However, it sinks the movie even more and creates a whole bunch of incongruencies and plot holes.\r\n\r\nThe film wasn\u2019t near good before the twist, and it gradually transformed itself into something jaw-droppingly bad, after it. In addition to this, the final message that Steven Knight leaves the audience with, is probably one of the worst ones since The Emoji Movie. \u201cDoing the wrong things for the right reasons\u201d is always going to be a controversial statement, but in this particular case, having in mind what happens in the movie and who does it involve, it\u2019s 100% wrong and I want to believe that Knight didn\u2019t exactly want to transmit this in the way that he did.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an intriguing and meaningful story to be told deep down in this messy screenplay. Behind all of the unnecessary exposition scenes (there\u2019s no need to describe what\u2019s happening since the twist is quite self-explanatory) and cringe-worthy dialogues, there\u2019s a well-structured narrative and an extraordinary concept to be explored. However, I have no idea what happened to the script nor the production and filming stages of the film, but I understand now why its original release date in October was postponed to the traditional January\u2019s garbage. This was supposed to be an Oscar-bait movie: an Oscar-nominated director/writer plus two Oscar-winner protagonists, in a film that seems to be more than what it actually is?  I guess the production companies saw this coming and they tried to prevent an even bigger flop. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m always the first to defend that a movie without at least \u201cgood\u201d technical attributes is rarely one of the best of the year. However, I\u2019m also the first to affirm that if a film fails to deliver a captivating story with compelling characters, there\u2019s no magnificent cinematography or mind-blowing special effects that can salvage it. Serenity doesn\u2019t even have that. Despite me feeling pleased that it was filmed in one-location and that the set design is pretty sweet, the editing is incredibly choppy. It feels like Knight had to remove several cuts in order to reduce the overlong runtime, which wasn\u2019t performed in the best way possible. There are a lot of moments where a character is facing a side, and in the next cut, the former is already facing a completely different one (this particular thing really occurs often).\r\n\r\nRegarding the characters, Baker and his son are definitely the ones that we learn more about since their connection is continuously addressed. Like I wrote above, there\u2019s a relevant story behind all of this mayhem, but I did saw (even if briefly) the light at the end of this very dark tunnel. That light is instantly consumed by the darkness as new characters or subplots start to show up, and the hollowness prevails over everything else. Jeremy Strong\u2019s character is baffling ridiculous, Diane Lane (Constance) is one of the dozens of logical reasons why the twist doesn\u2019t work, but the one who annoyed me the most didn\u2019t even show up. You spend a whole movie talking about this one person, like it is going to be a crucial subplot, and then you forget about it. You merely end the film, and it\u2019s like that character was never even mentioned\u2026 Why? Why give even more reasons for someone to leave the theater frustrated?\r\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s the tone. It\u2019s weird until the twist and weirder after it. Not even Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway can save themselves from some awfully delivered lines. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the cast who saves this wreckage of being an F. McConaughey is a hell of an actor and he demonstrates his outstanding range throughout the runtime. Hathaway has less to do, and I felt that her lines were the worst, but I can\u2019t argue with her ability to deliver any emotion. Jason Clarke (Frank Zariakas) is perfect as the violent father/husband, and Djimon Hounsou (Duke) has some space to shine.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Serenity tries to go big and bold, but falls astonishingly flat. Plot holes, logical incongruencies, awful dialogues, terrible editing, hollow characters, and neglected subplots. Steven Knight had a great concept and a truly interesting thriller-mystery in his mind, but his execution is shockingly baffling, and the twist transforms everything into something way worse. The final message is the number one reason why I don\u2019t recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if you take teens or kids with you. Matthew McConaughey is good enough to avoid a total disaster, and I know that there was something incredible behind all of this horrible mess. It\u2019s probably going to end up as one of the worst films of 2019, unless we have a truly disastrous year in cinema.\r\n\r\nRating: D-"
