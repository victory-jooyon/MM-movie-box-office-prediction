Too random sequences of present and past, though the point was proven. It's nothing, but a simple romance drama. Most close to the real world relationship. You would still feel the cinematic effect, yet if you encounter a scene that happened in your life and around you, that won't be a surprise. Because a relationship has to go through such phases.\r\n\r\nI felt like the dialogues should have been much better, because I can't point out it was whether editing issue or the dialogues. At the end, I realised it was the character Peter, designed in that way. Yep, he seems an average, particularly his skills against women, are poor. So I felt bad for Vandy to get trapped with such person. But love can strike anywhere to/with anyone, right! This is a decent film if you like to take a chance, because it is not your regular romance-drama.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_"

But after watching it, I was surprised. First off,this movie was way,( and I mean), way better then the last two movies were. It was darker and had a lot of elements from the first movie, which I loved. I don't want to give away too much, but I do want to say that the last scene of the movie will leave you speechless. It had me thinking, \"OMG, that was AMAZING how they came up with that twist.\" One last thing I loved about this movie was that it was well planned out and thought of, unlike the forth movie which was a joke and in my opinion, shouldn't have never been made. The deaths weren't rushed as opposed to the deaths in the forth movie, and it gave more screen time to introduce us to the characters. Note: I will say that there is one death scene in the movie that I didn't see coming, besides the ending. I recommend you see this movie. It might have the same theme as the first four movies, but unlike the first four, it's on a much higher scale."
