            "review": "'The Martian\u2019 is definitely in the creative wheelhouse of filmmaker Ridley Scott whose Science Fiction sensibilities are grounded in colorful futuristic fantasies that tiptoe in grand whimsy.  The veteran auteur responsible for such pop cultural high-minded spectacles in \u2018Alien\u2019, \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 and even the mixed bag reception of \u2018Prometheus\u2019 certainly brings a sophisticated and thought-provoking vibe to the probing aura of \u2018The Martian\u2019. As with other Scott-helmed productions, \u2018The Martian\u2019 settles nicely in its majestic scope that taps into visual wonderment, humanistic curiosities, technical impishness and the surreal spryness of the SF experience.\r\n\r\nThe exploratory nature of \u2018The Martian\u2019 is its own noteworthy mission. Scott arms his frothy planetary odyssey with a sense of thematic inquisitiveness and intelligence while meshing human consciousness and scientific forethought. Clearly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is astutely meditative and one can thankfully block in their memory banks some of Scott\u2019s mediocre misses (anyone care to recall the monumental mishaps in the form of the flimsy \u2018The Counselor\u2019 or the unintentional laughfest that was \u2018Exodus: Gods And Kings\u2019?). Rightfully so, \u2018The Martian\u2019 shares its crafty crater of similarities with other space-place spectacles that resonated with the imagination and innovation such as the Academy Award-winning \u2018Gravity\u2019 and the under-rated \u2018Interstellar\u2019. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is elegantly arresting in its sheer skin for both the character studies and the major plight involved (particularly anchored on the shoulders of star Matt Damon as the contemplative lead) as well as the trademark Scott-induced flourishes that incorporate crisp and cunning visual special effects and a sweeping musical score that invites a transfixing hold on one\u2019s indelible spirit.\r\n\r\n\u2018The Martian\u2019 is the film adaptation of Andy Weir\u2019s best-selling tome. Scott\u2019s disciplined direction and screenwriter Drew Goddard\u2019s ambitious vision of Weir\u2019s compelling written material seemingly gels in convincing, cerebral fashion. The premise is not wildly original as it revisits the familiar foundation of a lost soul in survival mode trying to take on the treacherous surroundings with philosophical conviction. Nevertheless, this does not make \u2018The Martian\u2019 any less formidable in its soul-searching perspective. Scott\u2019s narrative on individualism and isolation with a tremendous technological tilt truly registers with boisterous bounce. Amazingly, Scott has assembled a capable and committed cast that are dedicated to making \u2018The Martian\u2019 look resourcefully skillful in its masterful mischievousness. Sure, The Martian\u2019s lengthy running time is staggering but it is compelling enough to invest in its meandering, adventurous narrative.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate nightmare (or perilous predicament\u2026take your choice) has been realised for one stranded space traveler in Mark Watney (Matt Damon). You see\u2026poor astronaut Watney had the misfortune of losing contact with his commander in Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of his crew when undergoing a scientific expedition to examine the terrain on Mars. Courtesy of an unexpected freakish storm Watney is separated from his comrades and believed to be dead as a result of the hazardous weather conditions on Mars. Lewis and her associates have no choice but to head back to Earth as searching for Watney may prove to be futile and endanger their lives as well.\r\n\r\nThus, Mark Watney is basically his own forced-upon version of \u2018Robinson Crusoe On Mars\u2019. There is no option for Watney but to allow his major survival instincts to kick in while striving for his jeopardised livelihood on the unpredictable and treacherous Red Planet\u2019s jagged landscape. Despite being stuck in hostile territory, Watney must use his background skills as a trained botanist to cultivate the scarce food he must rely on for his unconventional nutrition. The only \u2018companion\u2019 that Watney has to relate to rests in the recorded device that captures his harried thoughts through video diaries (at least this is more practical than what Tom Hanks\u2019s \u2018Castaway\u2019 character had in his possession with inanimate object best buddy, Wilson the volleyball).\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the devastating news about Mark Watney\u2019s possible death far beyond the reaches of home hits his colleagues understandably hard as tributes start to pour in remembrance of the seemingly dearly departed space pioneer. Soon, there is some measure of hope when NASA officials that include head honchos Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels from TV\u2019s \u2018The Newsroom\u2019), Vincent Kapoor (the Oscar-nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor from \u201912 Years A Slave\u2019) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) find evidence that Watney may be alive and ready to be rescued. Naturally, a sense of urgency is warranted to retrieve the weary astronaut without causing too many public relations waves. This puts press aide Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) into damage control mode in particular.\r\n\r\nOkay...so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nOkay\u2026so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nImportantly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is clever and carefully conceived because it does not have to rely on the excess baggage to convey its entertainment value in a series of hyperactive and hedonistic happenings. Ridley Scott is soundly methodical in presenting a low-key terrifying tale of loneliness and resiliency and what it takes to handle the pressure of adversity when there is no glimmer of humanity around to reinforce or remind one of such psychological obstacles. The intriguing factor here is the science-friendly serving of intelligence and insight that builds up the audience\u2019s appreciation for the underlying suspense. Interestingly, the conflict approached in \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not so much the back-and-forth high-scale struggles of man versus outlandish creature or an over-the-top diabolical deviant out to destroy the world in cartoonish fashion. No, the genuine combative and confrontational war of will is contained in one vulnerable man\u2019s ability to face the unknown grounded in both doubt and determination. Hence, Scott has made a palpable thinking man\u2019s Science Fiction exposition rooted in articulated forethought.\r\n\r\nDamon more than holds his own as the disillusioned botanist/astronaut out on an ominous limb as his doomed odyssey of uncertainty is something that the common viewer can embrace and relate to without question. The perceived opulence in \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not contained in the film\u2019s production values per se (Scott has made previous movies with more visual vitality and purpose) but subtly showcased in the concepts of  knowledgeable tidbits concerning food rations, mathematical equations, crucial time tables, planetary probes, NASA-themed procedural techniques and aerodynamics considerations.\r\n\r\nHopefully, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not dismissed as a foreign alien in the minds of ardent movie-going SF enthusiasts looking for a realistic and soulful space-age adventure with a refreshing backbone of scientific curiosity and candidness.\r\n\r\nThe Martian (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 35 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover and Benedict Wong\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ridley Scott\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Space Adventure/Science and Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)"

When shady Roman leader Tiberius (Adrien Brody) arrives with an army of 100,000, the other two groups team-up against them.\r\n\r\nSupposedly inspired by real-life events, \"Dragon Blade\" (2015) is a Chinese action/adventure that cost $65 million and looks it. The film is top-of-the-line as far as production quality goes (score, cast, costumes, sets, quick editing, locations, etc.). Chan is entertaining as usual while Cusack and Brody surprisingly tower in their roles (I say \u201csurprisingly\u201d because I wouldn\u2019t have imagined them cutting it as Roman commanders in the ancient past). The tone is serious with goofy quick-edited action and a modest amount of humor that\u2019s actually funny.\r\n\r\nIf you happened upon any 2-3 minutes of this film you\u2019d automatically think that it was a very worthy adventure flick. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too manic for its own good. I tried to adapt to its hyper tone and did so until just past the halfway mark when the overkill action style pretty much lost me. I endured to the end, but it was difficult. It seriously needed to slow down and cultivate depth (but at least it tries to at times). \r\n\r\n\u201cDragon Blade\u201d lacks the confident poise of the excellent \u201cMongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan\u201d (2007) and instead shoots for overKILL. Consider the frenzied pace of the 2011 version of \u201cConan the Barbarian,\u201d but up the ante a couple of notches. That\u2019s this movie.      \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Hengdian and Dunhuang, China, as well as the Gobi Desert.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C"
