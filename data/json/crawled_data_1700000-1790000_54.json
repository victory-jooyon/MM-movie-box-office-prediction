It transforms her heart into a stone and puts her under a queer curse. She is to be the evil Countess of Stones and live in a stone tower. If the greatest gem-cutter in the world brings the stone of Alatyr to life, though, she'll become the ruler of the world. The Stone Countess, now cruel and selfish, is fascinated with the idea. She starts searching for the best gem-cutters and forces them to work with Alatyr, so the magical stone would become a living thing. Neither of the gem-cutters succeeds, so she kills them. While being imprisoned in her tower, they work on a large book about the secrets of gem-cutting. Each of them edits the book, so it's later named \"the Book of Masters\".",

            "review": "Words cannot express how incredibly overwrought, insipid, hyperactive and foolishly exaggerated the third entry into the action-packed _XXX_ film franchise is in the nonsensical and numbing operative spectacle **XXX: Return of Xander Cage**. Monosyllabic muscle-bound action star Vin Diesel revisits the rollicking and roguish skin of athletic spy/sports enthusiast Xander Cage in yet another splashy yet sophomoric throbbing thrill-ride that only diehard Diesel fanboys will swallow with unapologetic fervor.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt Diesel knows where his bread is buttered in terms of his secured box office appeal. The pumped-up performer has initiated the hoopla with a couple of popular action flicks in the past only to leave them briefly before deciding to return front and center. Diesel has done this tactic with the inexplicably desired _The Fast and the Furious_ movie series as well as the aforementioned _XXX_ offerings (actor/singers Tyrese Gibson and Ice Cube inherited the big screen honors in replacing the absent Diesel in these energized ditties respectively). Now Diesel is called into service once again to capitalize on the extreme spy genre while satisfying those thrill-seekers whose thirst for the James Bond and Jason Bourne action-grabbers may be perceived as relentlessly mild as the acrobatic antics of the hip Bald Bold One looks to overshadow his competitors in daunting dumbness.\r\n\r\nBottom line: who the heck was cramming for the ridiculous return of the attention-getting Xander Cage other than the motivated machismo of star/co-producer Diesel strutting his all-too-familiar slick shtick in an empty-minded vanity project that is jumpier than a kangaroo with the hiccups? There is nothing like playing to the convoluted escapism and exploiting the loyal demographics that continue to get a charge out of Diesel\u2019s boisterous brand from the _Fast and Furious_ enterprise that still sizzles for some and fizzles for others. Nevertheless, this espionage eyesore features Diesel\u2019s Cage at his best\u2026and that is not saying much. He is as smooth as ice soothing your ailing tonsils. Check. He is a chick magnet to the highest degree. Check again. He can turn his biceps and brawn into an invaluable weapon for the safety of his country and comrades. Double check and then some. Overall, we get it\u2026Xander Cage is a badass without boundaries and daredevil Diesel and his on-screen cohorts wants to reinforce such titillating tripe. Go figure.\r\n\r\nGranted that **XXX: Return of Xander Cage\u2019s** sole purpose is to play into the pulsating popcorn pleasure of its audience while expecting one not to take the excitable escapades too seriously. Still, the tired formula for this particular genre in general (not to mention a Vin Diesel-starring vehicle) feels utterly uninspired and recycled despite the ambitious showcasing of active triggers that include high-wire skiing through the woods, dirt bike surfing, daring skateboarding prowess while clinging to the side of a moving bus and oh yeah\u2026a lot of colorful butt-kicking tactics to boot. The highly stylized lifestyle of the free-wheeling Cage is by-the-numbers hedonism\u2013cause havoc, conquer the lovely ladies hormonal for his suave affections and come off looking cool this side of 70\u2019s knockoff bad motherf&%$# private eye John Shaft in taking care of business. Great spy work if you can conjure it up for indiscriminate action junkies wanting to engage in this souped-up silliness without rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite familiar with the Xander Cage \u201cmythology\u201d he was an extreme sports talent that had been recruited by NSA head honcho Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to utilize his competitive skills and abilities undercover. Now Cage is back in the saddle as he horses around on yet another challenging assignment that finds him butting heads with a trio of baddies in Deepika Padukone\u2019s Serena, Donnie Yen\u2019s Xiang and Tony Jaa\u2019s Talon\u2013a threatening threesome experimenting with dangerously rigging outer space satellites or something to that trivial effect. Of course the crafty Cage\u2013beyond wily and reckless\u2013is often reigned in by the likes of his superiors including Agent Jane Marke (Oscar and Emmy nominated Australian actress Toni Collette needlessly toiling away in this toothless contraption of a spy thriller).\r\n\r\nDirector D.J. Caruso (2016\u2019s \u201cThe Disappointments Room\u201d) merely goes through the motions with this disjointed spy caper that flexes its moronic muscles without offering much else to the preposterous proceedings. The displayed dialogue in a Lucky Charms cereal commercial has more credibility than the words leaving the lips of the featured players in this woefully generic actioner. Diesel, who has shown some promise as an actor in previous critical fare from yesteryear such as 2000\u2019s _Boiler Room_ and 2006\u2019s _Find Me Guilty_ has since played it safe and relied on the frivolous \u201csure thing\u201d with the repetitive Furious installments and other fluffy movie projects that had diminished his potential in Hollywood beyond the brainless blow-em-up cinema that he finds automatic comfort in churning out as a cinematic safety net.\r\n\r\nAlthough they say that a single \u201cX\u201d usually marks the spot it takes triple X\u2019s to disprove this theory when welcoming back the chaotic coolness that is Diesel\u2019s detached dude in cocky-minded Xander Cage\u2013the sensationalized showboat that should have left his debuted one-dimensional adventurous tendencies back in 2002.\r\n\r\n**XXX: Return of Xander Cage** (2017)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)"

He likes a drink or twelve, likes to beat down on bad guys and is a constant source of PR hassle for his superior. When a serial killer known as Blitz (Aidan Gillen) starts killing police officers, Brant takes it personal.\r\n\r\nIt is what it is really, just what you would expect from a Statham movie, where the tagline says it all, Cop Killer Vs Killer Cop! There's lots of chases, fighting, quips, brooding menace and with Brant teamed up with Paddy Considine's gay Officer Nash, some room for cheeky devilment. Director Elliott Lester and cinematographer Rob Hardy favour a scuzzy colour palette that befits the London locations, all while Ilan Eshkeri's sound tracking pounds away its feral beats.\r\n\r\nOne sub-plot involving Zawe Ashton's rehab released copper doesn't serve much of a purpose, and you have to take with a pinch of salt how Blitz goes about his business (he leaves finger prints everywhere!) But it's The Stath kicking butt and that is more often than not good enough for a good time, such is the case here. 6.5/10"

I like Jonah Hill, but this is after he found some range and before he learned to control it, intense doesn't not equate funny.  I thought Richard Ayoade would save it, but he just stood by and watched the train wreck happen.  I do chuckle a bit thinking of him asking the other guys if this is stuff Americans find funny.\r\n\r\nThis has a great premise, average joes find alien invaders, so good in fact, it's basically a trope, but the way this presents it feels like they tried to steal it from \"Laser Team\" and then legally distinct it from that property.\r\n\r\nLong story short, there just isn't a lot of value in the movie.  It's not that funny, it is basically a huge commercial for Costco and some other obvious brands.  There is so much money poured into something that feels like a waste.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's done by professionals, it looks great, even if I don't like the Xenos design, and there is a decent script at the core of this.  There is just an overall fail of execution, and lack of interesting characters and story.\r\n\r\nYou should go watch \"The World's End\" instead."

            "review": "There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.\r\n\r\nEverything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is \u2013 let's be honest \u2013 precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all \u2013 the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and \u2013 big shock \u2013 it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.\r\n\r\nWell, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.\r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.\r\n\r\nThis was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a filmmakers' case of \"could've, would've, should've\". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.\r\n\r\nNo story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.\r\n_(June 2013)_"

            "review": "Sometimes a film can turn out to be nothing like you expected, and it can be a real challenge not to be completely disappointed, but rather try and keep an open mind about what you're watching instead of dismissing it just because it's not what you thought it would be. Because every now and then, you just need to let something surprise you. Defendor is just such a film.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, everything about this film just screams 'hilarious comedy' (trailers can be so misleading...). Perhaps it was the production company's intention to promote it as such, but it is nothing of the sort. But then again, if they were afraid a dramatic film about a sympathetic loser who thinks he's a superhero wasn't going to fly with the audience, they shouldn't have made it in the first place. But they did and here it is, and it's no surprise it wasn't a big box office success. That's bad promotion for you.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Defendor certainly has its charm, mostly, if not completely, thanks to Woody Harrelson. I've personally never seen him fail, and there's something about the way he plays this character that just makes him instantly lovable. He plays a really sweet, 'intellectually challenged' man named Arthur Poppington who prefers to be addressed as his vigilante alter-ego Defendor (with an O!), blindly convinced of his duty to defend the needy. The fact that he has no real skills, hardly any physical strength and relies on marbles, angry wasps and lemon juice as his weapons of choice, never deter him in any way. In fact, they're exactly the ingredients that make up his identity. \"Guns are for cowards!\" is his credo.\r\n\r\nBut it's only fun and games until he assaults the owner of a dry cleaner's and is placed under court-ordered psychiatric supervision. Here his story slowly unravels and it becomes apparent that there's much more to this silly, troubled superhero wannabe than meets the eye. In conversations with his psychiatrist we learn of his friendship with a young hooker named Kat and his obsession with catching his arch enemy, Captain Industry, whom he holds responsible for a traumatising experience in his childhood.\r\n\r\nLet me start with the films plus points. First of all, the cast is great. Like I said, Woody Harrelson never fails and his portrayal of Defendor is charming, sympathetic and just plain sweet. He is a simple man, but his intentions are genuinely heartfelt and righteous. When he's not fighting crime (with marbles...) he tries to help this girl Kat to kick her habit of drug use. And of course, he ends up needing her just as much as she needs him. This character is played by Kat Dennings, who is not yet very well known, but I have a feeling she definitely will be. I think she has more personality and talent than most \"glamorous\" young actresses that you see in every magazine these days, and she's very pretty, so that should work in her favour. Her character in this film is a tough, streetwise young woman, who has seen more and done more than any girl her age should, and she plays her role with style. Actually, the film mostly revolves around the chemistry between these two characters, and that chemistry is great.\r\n\r\nElias Koteas plays an undercover cop, Dooney, who keeps getting in Defendor's way. Although he is a good actor, his role here isn't very memorable. The same goes for Sandra Oh, who plays Arthur's psychiatrist. Not bad, but not irreplaceable. Basically, these characters could have been played by anybody. But that has more to do with the fact that these characters simply weren't written interestingly enough.\r\n\r\nAlthough Defendor is said to be a comedy, the funny moments are few and far in between, and although these moments are pretty hilarious here and there, there really aren't enough of them for this film to qualify as a full-fledged comedy. And that's not a bad thing, but if you're going to watch it, you should understand that this film is more of a drama film than a comedy, it's simply too dark and heavy for that. Thematically, Defendor focuses more on the main characters' issues than on the silly things they do. Though it must be said that Defendor's actions against his enemies make for some of the film's best moments, although said actions are actually more endearing than they are effective.\r\n\r\nSomething about this film that could have definitely used some improvement is the pacing. It takes too long for the story to really take off, and when it does it continues to just kind of meander along, without properly working towards a decent climax. Also, the ending isn't really satisfying. Actually, it is quite weak. This falls in line with the overall fluctuating quality of the story, which never really engages you much at any point, and then at the end just leaves you feeling kind of puzzled and somewhat disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Defendor is a charming little film, not strong enough to garner its own cult-following like some films in this genre have, but definitely nice enough to watch at least once.\r\n_(February 2012)_"

I'd argue the voice cast do good work, principally Dan Fogler as Gribble. Seth Green/Seth Dusky (Milo), Elisabeth Harnois (Ki) and Joan Cusack (Mom) are all fine too.\r\n\r\nThe sci-fi parts are undercooked certainly, but I feel what's there works well enough for Milo's side of the story. The end few scenes are meaningful, I did care for the characters what can I say. Animation-wise I liked it as well, especially for the humans. It does look a tad weird, granted.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I rate it."

Personally, this was very large shoes to fill only 3 years after the original.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the movie is almost beat for beat the original, and they even got \tPeter Dinklage to reprise the same role (apparently a rare thing to do in the industry), which begs why they didn't get Alan Tudyk, also American, to reprise his role (and my fav from the original).  James Marsden tries to put his personal spin on it, but it does look like he is very much imitating Tudyk for the most part.\r\n\r\nLuke Wilson replaces the Scottish role, being the only other white actor which says more about how the English take to the Scots as out of sorts than anything.  It's a stupid thing: the whole world should get along better.\r\n\r\nThis is an awesome cast: Zoe Saldana, Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover (probably my favorite in this one), Tracey Morgan, Kevin Hart, and Keith David.  And they're all fantastic, even the people I'm less familiar with were on point.  So I do give this version points for better casting and bigger personalities.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a little brighter, a little more fun with the characters, but it's still the same great, funny story.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't blame you for watching one over the other, but I still like the original better, mostly for Alan Tudyk."

Given free licence to bring Cohen and his operations down by any means necessary, the Gangster Squad fight fir with fire.\r\n\r\nLoosely based on real life facts, Gangster Squad is a good old slice of machine gun etiquette. An all star cast get to play good guys and wise guys in The Untouchables tradition, even if that in itself can\u2019t quite lift the film to the higher echelons of gangster movies past and present.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing new here, it plays out as expected. Brolin and Gosling are the main smooth operators in the good guys camp, the former given the family man in danger sub-plot, the latter given the dangerous dame to fall in love with in the shapely form of Emma Stone, who as it happens is also dating Cohen!  hmm... \r\n\r\nOver in the wise guys department is Penn on full tilt sweary and hammy overdrive. It\u2019s a very colourful portrayal, menacing and completely over the top. How the performance sits with you will greatly depend on how you find Penn as an actor when let loose on a cartoon characterisation.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all very period pleasing, with a bustling late 40s L.A. hosting men with hats, trench coats and tommy-guns. Men who frequent the speakeasy bars as torch singers warble their stuff. There is nothing wrong with the production at all, except maybe when the dialogue veers to clunky. The action scenes are well crafted, loud, bloody and exciting, and the photography sparkles and the music soars.\r\n\r\nIf only the makers had put some thought into it, a bit of brains to go with the brawn. As a comic book type gangster piece, it works well on entertainment terms, elsewhere its lightweight and formula compliant ,  with the Ribisi, Patrick and Pena characters telegraphed a mile away.  So, quite some way away from the great The Untouchables  then, but better than Mullholland Falls. Make of that what you will. 6.5/10  "

Exactly as the original novel."

So I wasn't really that excited about watching this movie. I guess, I can say, I went with the flow. I wanted to be one of those people who have seen this movie. It was a holiday because of the President's inauguration. So we went to Podium because I know there will be more people in bigger theaters. Many showtimes were sold out already. So we decided to buy tickets for the last full show. We stayed and played with Toby the whole after noon and after dropping off Edward, straight to Podium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie was much better than New Moon. There's more action and the romance between Jacob and Bella are deeper now. More screen time for the Cullen family. The music is better than New Moon having some songs that are more alike than Twilight. I didn't like the makeup. It was not consistent and Bella's hair was the worst. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B-. It was nice but nothing beats Twilight still."
